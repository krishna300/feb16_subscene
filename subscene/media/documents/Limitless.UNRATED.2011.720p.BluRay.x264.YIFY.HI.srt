00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,793
I guess somebody
gave me a wake up call.

504
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:16,046
I hope you didn't do it for me.

505
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,256
No, I just wanted to
apologize to you, Lin.

506
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:23,053
And let you know that apparently
my capacity for self-sabotage

507
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:25,138
wasn't boundless after all.

508
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:29,184
The real question is,
why did you ever put up with me?

509
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:32,270
I was in love with you.

510
00:35:39,028 --> 00:35:40,570

511

512
00:35:42,615 --> 00:35:44,282

- Good.

513
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:46,701

- Yeah.

514
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:51,206

515
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:54,417
You know... I'm really
happy you're here with me.

516
00:35:57,505 --> 00:36:01,549

LINDY: "In a sizzling three days of trading,

525
00:36:32,706 --> 00:36:35,500
the unknown Mr. Morra
trumped the market,

526
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:38,461
prompting one top hedge
fund manager to comment:

527
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:41,506
'He's Houdini. He's a
prophet of our times."'

528
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,924

- "He's God"?
- You coming over later?

530
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:48,138
I can't. I don't have a key.

531
00:36:48,222 --> 00:36:49,472
Oh, that's right.

532
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,668
- Can I have it back?
- Uh... Nope.

533
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:55,586
- No?
- I mean, does it have to be that key?

534
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,505
Can it be a new key?

535
00:36:58,632 --> 00:37:00,383
To our place?

536
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:06,055

- And you say I'm not practical.

540
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,965
Nothing.

541
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:43,968

you ate something?

in the Post, buddy.

Now, be warned. He's mercurial.

551

One minute, your best friend,
the next, you're a leper.

552

And he needs direct answers. Anything
tentative and you've lost him forever.

553

a few scenarios.

So, Eddie Morra.

563
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:22,525
- What's your secret?
- Medication.

564
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:24,318
I'm on special medication.

565
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,362
Okay.

566
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,908
EDDIE: Well, it's a formula with a complex method.

567
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,411
But, of course, research was a
component. Massive research.

568
00:39:33,495 --> 00:39:36,539
I knew every helix of every scrap of
DNA in every company I bought.

569
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:39,250
Papers stacked like the Himalayas
in my office, and you know what?

570
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,460
- The stocks went up.
- By a hair.

571
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,714
Sure, the stocks rose, but who
wants to do all that work

572
00:39:44,798 --> 00:39:46,340
for a shitty little uptake?

573
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,594
It's not the visceral kind of spike you
want in short term holdings so...

574
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,345
...I dispensed with all the hard statistics

575
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,722
and I went right to the rumor mill.

576
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:55,933
So you bought your stocks based on what?
The tom-toms beating in the street?

577
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:59,520
Sure. Share prices aren't really based
on how a company works.

578
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,105
It's about how mass psychology works.

579
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,399
So, if I found certain algorithms
in the perception of the stock...

580
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:05,776
Pattern recognition.
That's your snake oil.

581
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,154
Well, not everybody
understands the patterns.

582
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:10,948
And that gave me a little bit more of
an uptake, but it's just a parlor trick.

583
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,617
So then, I went on to door number three.

584
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:16,037
Are you really implying that you have
some sort of ultimate formula?

585
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:19,373
Well, from 12,000
to 2.3 million in ten days.

586
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,919
- I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.
- Delusions of grandeur.

587
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:27,215
I don't have delusions of grandeur, I
have an actual recipe for grandeur.

590

a way which I haven't seen before.

595

and tell me what you think.

596

- Right now? (CLEARS THROAT)
- Yeah. Take your time.

one company with enough bling

01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:03,990
I'm sorry... Tyler, I gotta go.

840
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:06,868
I'm sick.

841
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:12,249
I shouldn't... I'm sorry.
I couldn't make it home.

842
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:15,418
- Let's get you to a hospital.
- No, no, no, no, no. I don't need...

843
01:00:15,503 --> 01:00:16,545
I need you to get...

844
01:00:16,629 --> 01:00:20,632
It's really simple, babe.
I need my pills.

845
01:00:20,716 --> 01:00:23,301
- Eddie, what pills?
- I don't... Babe, it's complicated.

846
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:26,137
What are you taking?
Are you on drugs?

848
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:32,561
EDDIE: I had no choice.
I told Lindy everything.

849
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:38,650
So all this energy of yours, all this focus...

850
01:00:38,734 --> 01:00:40,026
...has been a drug.

851
01:00:40,111 --> 01:00:42,487
Well, it was supposed to be legal.

852
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:46,157
I have a... a supply stashed.

853
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,661
You want me to go get it.

854
01:00:49,745 --> 01:00:53,206
- No. No, no, no. I'm gonna go get it.
- Give me your keys.

855
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:54,958
I'll go to your apartment.

856
01:00:55,042 --> 01:00:58,920
It's not... in my apartment. I moved it.

857
01:00:59,005 --> 01:01:02,799
(LAUGHS) Okay, so where did you move it?

858
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,474
In my house.

859
01:01:13,311 --> 01:01:14,769

Are you sure?

866
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:40,378
Yeah. He got into the cab behind me

867
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,464
and he's making every turn I'm making.

868
01:01:42,548 --> 01:01:46,384
- Baby, call the cops.
- Can you go around him?

Unless you see a real threat, I never want
it known that I have any security.

You'll never precede me,
you'll always follow me.

952
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:18,044
Never more than 15 steps behind. 
And never stand too close together.

953
01:09:18,128 --> 01:09:20,838

if the opportunity presents itself.

suit. This isn't The Matrix.

You have to know, Eddie, I wrote you off.

956
01:09:32,518 --> 01:09:34,143
- I was sick.
- You don't get sick.

957
01:09:34,228 --> 01:09:36,938
You're playing at this level, you get
hit by a car, you don't even die.

- You're absolutely right.
- I know I'm right.

959
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:41,651
I mean, I didn't know
who or what I was talking to.

A hundred and five. That's who you
were talking to, Carl. Delirium.

01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:47,573
Mm-hm.

962
01:09:47,658 --> 01:09:49,367
I sent over my revised projections.

963
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:50,368
I didn't ask for your projections.

964
01:09:50,994 --> 01:09:53,604
I know, but I think if you
take a look at them...

965
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,690
I already have. As a matter of fact...

966
01:09:57,234 --> 01:10:00,445
...I fired a few people over your projections.

967
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,155
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

968
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,033
You're relieved that
you know things my team missed.

969
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:09,662
The minute, the instant
that's no longer true...

970
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,167
EDDIE: Two months after I'd started NZT,

971
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:17,336
I was brokering the biggest merger
in corporate history.

972
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:21,841
Ironically, it's gonna be crude. Crude is
gonna be where we're gonna hit them.

973
01:10:21,925 --> 01:10:24,552
Which yields a prospective
profit of 200 percent.

974
01:10:24,636 --> 01:10:26,512
That makes both of us
very happy campers.

975
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:28,973
EDDIE: I found that
if I maintained an even dose,

976
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,392
remembered to eat, drank no alcohol,

977
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,895
- the blackouts didn't recur.
- How you doing, Eddie?

978
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:37,815
Tom, is it possible to construct an
imperceptible compartment?

979
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,358
In this jacket?

980
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:42,862
- In all of them.
- Certainly, sir.

981
01:10:42,946 --> 01:10:47,033
EDDIE: Safer though my stash now was,
I was not sitting around until it ran out.

982
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:50,453
Can I combine these ingredients in
the same exact quantity, yes, but,

983
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:55,333
the exact method of delivery to the
brain... Darts at a dartboard.

984
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,044
- Meaning?
- Clinical trials, guinea pig people.

985
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:00,630
- That's gonna take too long.
- It's what it is.

986
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:04,217
Or you'll kill people.
You need 12, to 18 months...

987
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:06,427
I'll give you two million dollars
if you can do it in six.

988
01:11:14,978 --> 01:11:18,898
I found that we can cut
costs 30 percent and, um...

989
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:23,653
Excuse me one second.

990
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:29,367
I thought we straightened
this out, Detective.

991
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:33,371
This isn't about Vernon Gant, Mr. Morra.

992
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,832
What is this about?

993
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:41,254
The witness identified the Maria
Winberg suspect as this person.

994
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:48,845
Wanna tell me your whereabouts
the night of April 2nd?

995
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:53,015
EDDIE: I couldn't keep this quiet on my own.

996
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:58,688
Enter Morris Brandt... the most
lethal lawyer in New York.

997
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:06,362
You're lucky somebody wiped the room.
It's weak. Circumstantial at best.

998
01:12:06,446 --> 01:12:09,448
Just between us, were you there?

999
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:10,783
I don't remember.

1000
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,911
I don't want to make concessions to you...

1001
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,038
EDDIE: Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood

1002
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:20,126
had no idea I might soon
be charged with murder.

1003
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,879
But SyCorps, Andine
and others are jockeying

1004
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:24,964
for the same industrial
concessions in Libya

1005
01:12:25,048 --> 01:12:27,300
that both our companies are pretending
we're not sniffing out.

1006
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:28,759
How do you know this?

1007
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:32,430
The governmental bribe system
is itself corrupt, so, of course,

1008
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:35,641
information about its inner workings,
like anything, can be bought.

1009
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:39,604
Go on.

1010
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:43,065
If you take a look at the lower
left-hand column, in 2008,

1011
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:46,569
five companies were jockeying for a
position before we even took notice.

1012
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:51,657
EDDIE: Jesus, he looks frail.

1013
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:55,077
- Could be an act.
- He's not even 60.

1014
01:12:57,414 --> 01:13:00,458
So, have you decided, Eddie?
What are you gonna do?

1015
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:03,628
When this is over?
I don't know.

1016
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,087
You haven't given me the answer.

1017
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:07,006
You haven't asked the question.

1018
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:08,841
Well, given the scale of my contribution,

1019
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,260
let's say 45.

1020
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:14,347
Done. Forty-five thousand dollars.

1021
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:17,850
Forty million is plenty, Eddie.
There's a lot more where that came from.

1022
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:20,228
You know, Eddie...

1023
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:21,354
...it may be on your mind

1024
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:23,856
that you're not gonna continue
to work for me anymore.

1025
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,650
This has been the 
learning experience of my life.

1026
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,194
I hope it has. I hope you don't think
you've gotten enough from me.

1027
01:13:28,278 --> 01:13:29,820
On to the next.

1028
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,657
Well, in order for a career to evolve,
I'm gonna have to move on.

1029
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:35,201
That you would even
think that would only show me

1030
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:37,703
how unprepared you
are to be on your own.

1031
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:40,164
- I mean, you do know you're a freak.
- (LAUGHS)

1032
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,750
Your deductive powers
are a gift from God, or chance,

1033
01:13:42,834 --> 01:13:45,169
or a stray shot of sperm, or whatever,
or whoever the hell wrote

1034
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,546
your life script, a gift not earned.

1035
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:51,509
You do not know what I know because
you have not earned those powers.

1036
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,302
You're careless with those powers.

1037
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:56,681
You flaunt them and you throw them around
like a brat with his trust fund.

1038
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:59,725
You haven't had to climb up all the greasy little rungs.

1039
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:02,770
You haven't been bored blind at the fundraisers.
You haven't done the time

1040
01:14:02,854 --> 01:14:04,689
in that first marriage
to the girl with the right father.

1041
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:07,483
You think you can
leap over all in a single bound.

1042
01:14:07,567 --> 01:14:10,069
You haven't had to bribe or charm
or threaten your way

1043
01:14:10,153 --> 01:14:13,364
to a seat at that table. You don't know
how to assess your competition

1044
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:16,659
because you haven't competed. Don't
make me your competition.

1045
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:21,539
Now, I'll open up a line of credit for you.

1046
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,666
You'll be wanting a few toys.

1047
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:44,020
EDDIE: Hotel rooms were no longer an option.

1048
01:14:44,104 --> 01:14:46,105
What I needed was a bunker.

1049
01:14:46,189 --> 01:14:48,607
WOMAN: There's a built-in safe,
central surveillance,

1050
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:51,277
vault grade pneumatic doors.

1051
01:14:51,361 --> 01:14:54,655
It's an unparalleled
three-tier security system.

1052
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:58,117
A fortress with a hell of a view.

1053
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:05,124
- What's the asking price?
- Eight-point-five.

1054
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:11,505
I'll take it.

1055
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:19,972
EDDIE: Right away,
it was obvious he was on NZT.

1056
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:22,725
Next week, I'm gonna need 20 pills.

1057
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:24,769
- Next week, you can go fuck yourself!
- (LAUGHS)

1058
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,437
Not that you'd feel anything.

1059
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:31,067
I don't think your Fortune 500 financial
friends would appreciate

1060
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:34,278
the details of your
little dilemma with the police.

1061
01:15:35,238 --> 01:15:37,990
Thursday, I'm gonna need the pills here.

1062
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,453
Getting smarter!

1063
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:46,332
EDDIE: Obviously, this could not go on,

1064
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:49,585
but there is very little on this earth
that 40 million dollars can't solve.

1065
01:15:49,669 --> 01:15:53,297
And tomorrow at nine,
Atwood would sign the papers.

1066
01:16:00,572 --> 01:16:03,574
- Do you want to call it?
- Cold feet?

1067
01:16:03,658 --> 01:16:06,243
There was all last night to tell us that.

1068
01:16:07,787 --> 01:16:11,040
- Anything?
- WOMAN: I'll call him again, sir.

1069
01:16:11,124 --> 01:16:13,334
EDDIE: Okay, the decision could have
changed. That makes sense.

1070
01:16:13,418 --> 01:16:16,795
The discourtesy doesn't. It's still on.

1071
01:16:17,589 --> 01:16:19,798
Oh, based on your charts and projections.

1072
01:16:20,759 --> 01:16:22,968
You know, remind me,
who the fuck are you, anyway?

1073
01:16:23,053 --> 01:16:25,763
I'm sorry, Carl, I've had it with this
unqualified, posturing little prick.

1074
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:27,973
- Pull it back.
- Since when is this the Delphic Oracle?

1075
01:16:28,058 --> 01:16:31,894
- Pull it back.
- WOMAN: Excuse me, Mr. Van Loon?

1076
01:16:31,978 --> 01:16:33,437
Mrs. Atwood is in your office.

1077
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,776
Ah. Mrs. Atwood, Carl Van Loon.

1078
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,278
- My associate, Edward Morra.
- Pleasure.

1079
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:46,325
I wanted to make this
as confidential as possible.

1080
01:16:46,409 --> 01:16:47,993
Of course.

1081
01:16:48,078 --> 01:16:51,997
My husband experienced some pain
and dizziness this morning.

1082
01:16:52,082 --> 01:16:54,625
He's currently at Lenox Hill,
undergoing tests.

1083
01:16:55,835 --> 01:16:57,795
I just want you to know
we have every intention

1084
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:59,588
of signing the contract.

1085
01:17:00,423 --> 01:17:03,634
And as soon as he is able,
we will proceed.

1086
01:17:04,803 --> 01:17:07,721
I realize this is a useless platitude, but
if there's anything that we can do,

1087
01:17:07,806 --> 01:17:09,139
please don't hesitate to tell us.

1088
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:11,058
Obviously, we want to be
as helpful and respectful

1089
01:17:11,142 --> 01:17:12,685
as possible, Mrs. Atwood.

1090
01:17:12,769 --> 01:17:15,562
Thank you, gentlemen.
I rely on your discretion.

1091
01:17:17,607 --> 01:17:18,649
CARL: There won't be a proxy.

1092
01:17:18,733 --> 01:17:21,777
No, a cagey prick like him giving
away power of attorney?

1093
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:28,242
CARL: Well, he'd better get better.

1094
01:17:31,371 --> 01:17:35,791
EDDIE: But Atwood wouldn't get better.
Because Atwood was out of NZT.

1095
01:17:39,296 --> 01:17:42,840
Well, why be surprised?

1096
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:46,343
EDDIE: How many other meteoric
rises might be explained by NZT?

1097
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,845
At least I had some.

1098
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:50,055
- My life wasn't in jeopardy.
- You can wait here.

1099
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:53,142
EDDIE: Only my money. And my liberty.

1100
01:17:54,561 --> 01:17:55,936
I've been all over with them.

1101
01:17:56,021 --> 01:17:58,397
We can't allow any disparity in race

1102
01:17:58,481 --> 01:18:01,233
or physical type between you
and the rest of the line up.

1103
01:18:01,318 --> 01:18:02,276
Okay.

1104
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,737
They're as close to your
clones as I could possibly get.

1105
01:18:04,821 --> 01:18:08,574
MORRIS: It's gotta be just one
big handsome blur to this guy.

1106
01:18:22,339 --> 01:18:24,256
EDDIE: Who was out there?

1107
01:18:26,009 --> 01:18:27,885
The woman's husband?

1108
01:18:28,678 --> 01:18:30,596
A hotel maid?

1109
01:18:32,557 --> 01:18:35,059
Was this how it was all going to end?

1110
01:18:39,397 --> 01:18:41,940
Not the dimmest clue.
He was dithering.

1111
01:18:42,025 --> 01:18:44,943
"He was the third one from the right.
No. Not him."

1112
01:18:45,028 --> 01:18:50,449
There you go. It's a thing of beauty.
You have that made?

1113
01:18:50,533 --> 01:18:52,117
I did.

1114
01:19:08,968 --> 01:19:10,803
WOMAN: (ON TV):
...market's been mixed today.

1115
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:13,597
The Dow has been
yo-yoing amidst speculation that

1116
01:19:13,681 --> 01:19:18,394
Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood
have negotiated a merger...

1117
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,271
Have you been talking to anyone?

1118
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:25,484
No, I haven't been talking to anybody,
Carl. I'm not stupid.

1119
01:19:25,568 --> 01:19:26,819
I know you're not stupid, Eddie,

1120
01:19:26,903 --> 01:19:28,821
but don't make
the classic smart person's mistake.

1121
01:19:28,905 --> 01:19:30,781
Thinking no one's smarter than you.

1122
01:19:30,865 --> 01:19:33,992
Where the hell have you been? This is the
second time you've turned to vapor.

1123
01:19:34,077 --> 01:19:36,954
I was in the building, I was getting coffee.
Why, has there been movement?

1124
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:39,331
Yeah, there's been movement
alright. Atwood's in a coma.

1125
01:19:39,416 --> 01:19:41,959
He wasn't playing us. He's dying.

1126
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:43,627
What do you know about this?

1127
01:19:43,711 --> 01:19:47,297
EDDIE: I was less than
usually equipped to answer.

1128
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:51,718
The dullness was coming on.
I was overdue to take my NZT.

1129
01:19:51,803 --> 01:19:55,013
And the pain was
starting behind my eyes.

1130
01:19:55,098 --> 01:19:56,348
Excuse me.

1131
01:19:56,433 --> 01:19:57,933
You're not excused.

1132
01:19:58,017 --> 01:20:00,561
What? A man in your employ
can't take a piss, Carl?

1133
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,127
EDDIE: Was it Brandt or someone else?

1134
01:20:25,211 --> 01:20:27,796
The police station? A coatroom?

1135
01:20:41,811 --> 01:20:43,061
Mr. Morra.

1136
01:20:43,146 --> 01:20:45,647
- Carl, I'm sorry...
- Mr. Morra. Mr. Morra!

1137
01:20:45,732 --> 01:20:47,483
- This just came for you.
- Yeah, what?

1138
01:20:52,071 --> 01:20:55,991
CARL: Hope not,
so let me know when you know.

1139
01:20:56,701 --> 01:20:58,660
All right, I'm gonna ask you again, Eddie.
What do you know about this?

1140
01:20:58,745 --> 01:21:01,705
- What? About the leak?
- No. About Atwood.

1141
01:21:01,789 --> 01:21:03,624
What? What about Atwood?

1142
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:05,959
Look, you got a long way
to go as a liar, kiddo.

1143
01:21:06,044 --> 01:21:07,252
- Carl, I don't know what you're...
- Listen!

1144
01:21:07,337 --> 01:21:08,712
What you're about to say is bullshit.

1145
01:21:08,796 --> 01:21:10,297
I know there's something
you're hiding from me.

1146
01:21:10,381 --> 01:21:12,257
I smell it on you. Right now,

1147
01:21:12,342 --> 01:21:15,719
I wanna know why this clusterfuck
of a deal is dead in the water!

1148
01:21:17,388 --> 01:21:19,431
Carl.

1149
01:21:19,515 --> 01:21:21,516
Eddie! Eddie!

1150
01:21:38,117 --> 01:21:40,061
MAN: (ON TV)
Outside Lenox Hill Hospital today,

1151
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,897
more twists and turns
in the Van Loon-Atwood merger.

1152
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:46,776
There is absolutely no truth
to the rumor of this merger.

1153
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,571
None whatsoever.
My husband is having tests.

1154
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:52,740
This is a difficult time.

1155
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:56,744
We would appreciate your directing
further questions to our attorney.

1156
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:59,247
Yes, we have no further
comments at this time.

1157
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,749
We're just awaiting the results
of the latest round of tests

1158
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:02,792
and hoping for the best.

1159
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,293
Thank you.
