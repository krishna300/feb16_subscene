1
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,583
The key to being a good mistress,

2
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:39,208
is to always having you wanting me,

3
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,458
more than I want you.

4
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,583
It's about the effort
I'm willing to make,

5
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:46,500
when the other person who's
at home doesn't anymore.

6
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:50,917
I like making you feel
like the priority.

7
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:54,458
I'm independent, financially stable,

8
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:57,041
and will never be a burden
to you or your family.

9
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:59,917
My days aren't filled thinking about

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,917
how to make our relationship work,

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,041
how to keep the spark,

12
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,250
or what I need to do to
keep you on the hook.

13
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:08,959
Of course, there are rules.

14
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,667
Don't put me in situations
that might be risky.

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,625
I don't want the accidental
run-ins with your friends,

16
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:19,625
or to be taken to a restaurant
you go to with your wife.

17
00:01:20,822 --> 00:01:22,750
I don't want to be on the radar.

18
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,709
I'm willing to live in the shadows,

19
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,250
and I prefer it that way.

20
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,030
I won't be your first phone call

21
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,583
when you and your wife have a fight.

22
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:34,500
You have friends for that,
and I am not your backup plan.

23
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,208
Yes, I'm your friend.

24
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,458
I'm happy to listen
and discuss the things

25
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:40,390
that are important to you,

26
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:42,573
but I'm not interested in
hearing about the issues

27
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,543
you and your wife deal
with on a day-to-day basis.

28
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:48,830
When all is said and done,

29
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:51,500
my hope is that I'm
out of the picture,

30
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,560
and you and your wife will
live happily ever after.

31
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,500
The time we spend
together is our time,

32
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,750
but when we're separate,
we're separate.

33
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:03,333
You have your life and I have mine.

34
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,205
I'm the only one,
there will be no others.

35
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:11,000
There will be no expensive
gifts or money exchanged.

36
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,709
We don't do holidays.

37
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:13,834
As far as I'm concerned,

38
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:16,500
Christmas should be
celebrated with your family,

39
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:17,583
not with me.

40
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,641
But the most important
rule of them all,

41
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,709
I am not your possession.

42
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:30,407
So you'll treat me, and my time,

43
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:32,104
with respect.

44
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:41,599
Have I told you how
incredible you look tonight?

45
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,750
You have Nathan, thank you again.

46
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:47,125
So, the last time we were together,

47
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,583
I was telling you about that deal,
the Jamison Merger?

48
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,083
Oh yes, that's right.

49
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,417
Veronica,

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,667
I closed it.

51
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,291
Congratulations.

52
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,250
That one was not easy,

53
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,500
but if everything pans out

54
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,709
we'll be opening offices
in Tokyo come August.

55
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:01,792
Fantastic.

56
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,484
Don't worry, I'll only be
gone a couple of weeks.

57
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:07,554
Sorry.

58
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:13,527
What if it's important?

59
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:14,620
You should take that.

60
00:03:14,631 --> 00:03:16,191
She can wait.

61
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:19,041
Nathan, you're not where
she thinks you are.

62
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,655
You should answer it.

63
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,671
If I answer that here,

64
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:24,222
she'll know I'm not where
I'm supposed to be.

65
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:26,989
Then why don't you go
outside and call her?

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Now, go on.

67
00:03:31,884 --> 00:03:34,553
Order us another bottle,
I'll be right back.

68
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:42,208
Look I told you I
couldn't be interrupted

69
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,375
while I was meeting
with these investors.

70
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,458
What's up?

71
00:03:47,523 --> 00:03:49,356
Say again?

72
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,825
You what?

73
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,005
Is everything okay?

74
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,166
I have to go.

75
00:04:00,224 --> 00:04:01,640
Why Nathan?

76
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:03,817
I'm sorry we didn't get
to have dinner together,

77
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:06,350
but at least we got
to share some wine.

78
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,875
I took care of the bill.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,663
I'll call you tomorrow.

80
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,667
Hi, Ian.

81
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,333
Wow, Veronica, you look amazing.

82
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:29,625
Oh you're so sweet,
how much do I owe you?

83
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:32,387
Uh it's gonna be $17.63.

84
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,917
Keep the change.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,042
Thanks.

86
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,417
So did you just get
dressed up for me,

87
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,207
or what's the occasion?

88
00:04:40,218 --> 00:04:42,008
No occasion.

89
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:43,782
My evening just ended early.

90
00:04:43,793 --> 00:04:44,845
If I was taking you out,

91
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:47,064
the evening wouldn't end early.

92
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,041
You know I'm old enough
to be your mother?

93
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,333
So?

94
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,500
I live enough on the edge as it is,
go.

95
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:56,917
Bye Veronica.

96
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:02,734
<i>Gonna have a talk with the President.</i>

97
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,375
<i>Oh, telling him we're gonna rob him?</i>

98
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,542
<i>Not a good idea, man.</i>

99
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,208
<i>I'm not telling, you idiot.</i>

100
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,724
<i>Oh,
you're the one stealing from the mob,</i>

101
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:13,484
<i>but I'm the idiot?</i>

102
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:16,500
<i>Point taken.</i>

103
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:20,333
<i>All right man, good luck,
you outta here?</i>

104
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,615
<i>You get caught,</i>

105
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,041
<i>your father,
he may forgive you, but not--</i>

106
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:29,208
<i>Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch,
touch, get up there,</i>

107
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:32,291
<i>touch, touch, out and hold.</i>

108
00:05:32,302 --> 00:05:33,322
<i>Hold.</i>

109
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,417
<i>Hold.</i>

110
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,917
<i>Another two is now, let's go.</i>

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,583
<i>Come on, you're better today
than you were yesterday,</i>

112
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:41,083
<i>but not as good as you'll
be tomorrow, come on.</i>

113
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:50,072
Ronnie, can you get that?

114
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,208
Just coming.

115
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,834
Bookaneer, can I help you?

116
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,850
Oh, hi Margie.

117
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:03,255
Oh, let me ask Trent,
hold on one sec.

118
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:04,125
Trent?

119
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,991
Did Margie's order come in yet?

120
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:08,639
Just, it's in the drawer
with her name on it.

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,343
Yep, it's right here.

122
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:19,835
Uh, no no, you can come in
tomorrow anytime after 10.

123
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:20,513
No, no no.

124
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:22,856
Right, bye bye.

125
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:25,836
No no no no no, you call her back.

126
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,138
Why?

127
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,365
You're meeting Adam tomorrow

128
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,250
at the Summerland
Estate at 11 o'clock.

129
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,458
You can handle Margie.

130
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:34,166
Just because I can,
doesn't mean I want to.

131
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,000
I know.

132
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,458
You do know, don't you?

133
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,333
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

134
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:39,959
She's fun.

135
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,581
She's awful.

136
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:44,471
I'm not even in the front door, and
you two are making fun of my outfit.

137
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:45,250
Hi, hon.

138
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:46,072
Hey Brandon.

139
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:46,987
What did I miss?

140
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:49,849
I'll fill you in at lunch,
I'm just gonna go get my purse.

141
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,625
Great, now we can charge double.

142
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:01,238
I'll make sure Ronnie gets
a couple of more copies

143
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:02,406
for you guys next week.

144
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:05,166
What we really need,
is for you to do an in-store signing,

145
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:07,061
it would really liven up the joint.

146
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:08,675
It's not my thing.

147
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,041
Could be.

148
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:12,542
Ready.

149
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,212
So, am I losing you for
the rest of the afternoon?

150
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:17,583
You're not gonna close
up early again, are you?

151
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,917
That happened once,
and it was an emergency.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,166
No,
I wanted to show you my new routine.

153
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,667
Oh, we certainly can't miss that.

154
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,500
Honey, I'm gonna be there,
later tonight.

155
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:28,009
It's okay Trent, I'll have her back

156
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,239
in a couple of hours.

157
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,834
Don't forget my doggie bag.

158
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:32,875
Woof.

159
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:38,461
Woof.

160
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,625
So, how was your date?

161
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,125
He left before dinner.

162
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:45,751
Oh, how are we feeling about this?

163
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,633
It's conflicted, you know.

164
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:51,719
I know I ought to feel mad,
but I don't and,

165
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,564
feel a little bit jealous,
and I shouldn't.

166
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:56,823
Jealous about what, exactly?

167
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:01,166
About my place,
and list of priorities.

168
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,166
I get that.

169
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,792
But he is married.

170
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,542
I know,
and I accept that but sometimes

171
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,252
it's harder than
others to understand.

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,514
So you like this guy?

173
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:16,698
As much as I like any of
the guys I go out with.

174
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,375
So, not enough.

175
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,584
What's that supposed to mean?

176
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,186
Am I supposed to want to
break up their marriage?

177
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,709
I want you to care enough

178
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:29,208
that you'd want them
to only be with you.

179
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,959
Is that what you would've
liked when we were dating?

180
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:35,364
Well, I would have been
the cause of your divorce,

181
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,375
and then we couldn't be the
friends that we are right now.

182
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,384
You didn't cause my divorce.

183
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,143
My marriage did.

184
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,917
Hey, my grandnephew's
birthday's next week.

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,680
Can you help me pick
out a present for him?

186
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,353
Great, how old is he?

187
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,375
Seven, I think.

188
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:00,961
No,
I'm sorry that title's out of print.

189
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,598
Yeah, even in paperback.

190
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,401
Out of print, is out of print.

191
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:07,409
Okay, oh gotta go.

192
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:09,398
All right, thank you.

193
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,583
Ho ho ho.

194
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,640
Beg, beg.

195
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,125
Ah, Portofino Italian Bistro,
my favorite.

196
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,208
Thank you.

197
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,375
Thanks for lunch.

198
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,792
My pleasure.

199
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,834
Thanks for helping me
pick out a gift for Bobby.

200
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,959
Movie tonight?

201
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,015
Ronnie, my showcase is tonight.

202
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,137
I guess that answers that,
do you want to join us?

203
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:31,698
I have to take a rain check.

204
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,375
Sure.

205
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,338
Hey, I'm going up the
coast to San Luis Obispo

206
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,120
to scout for my new book.

207
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:38,792
Wanna go?

208
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,115
I love our trips, yeah, I'm in.

209
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,458
Great.

210
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:48,546
What?

211
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:49,445
Nothing.

212
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,456
Okay.

213
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,625
What?

214
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:53,882
Nothing.

215
00:09:53,937 --> 00:09:55,823
Have fun tonight.

216
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:56,834
Bye.

217
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,146
What?

218
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:02,825
Nothing, go, do, I'll see you later.

219
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:49,542
I'm glad you could make it today.

220
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,901
Thank you for arranging this.

221
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:53,407
The vultures will pillage everything

222
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:55,375
but the paint from the
walls when they arrive.

223
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,255
But you get carte Blanche.

224
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:07,244
In here.

225
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:09,017
Why?

226
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:11,827
You know how I always
take care of you.

227
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:17,051
Love is a smoke

228
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,041
raised with the fume of sighs,

229
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:23,740
being purged, the fires
sparkling in lovers' eyes.

230
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,082
Being vexed, a scene
nourished with lovers' tears.

231
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,583
What is it else?

232
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,208
A madness most discreet.

233
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:35,128
A choking gall.

234
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:36,546
And a preserving sweet.

235
00:11:38,884 --> 00:11:39,884
You know this?

236
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,851
Of course, Romeo and Juliet.

237
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,913
The forbidden lovers.

238
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,710
Have a drink with me tonight.

239
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:55,578
Adam, you're married,
and I'm seeing someone.

240
00:11:57,523 --> 00:12:00,041
You know I'll keep
asking until you say yes.

241
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,625
And history has proven that.

242
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,182
Well, points for persistence.

243
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:08,242
Help me,
I want to get these to the store.

244
00:12:15,347 --> 00:12:17,750
Oh Ronnie,
we really hit the jackpot here.

245
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:19,433
Tell me about it.

246
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,792
Hi Margie.

247
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,291
Good day, my dear.

248
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,750
Hello Trent.

249
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:29,834
Hello.

250
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,817
There you go.

251
00:12:32,864 --> 00:12:33,947
It's for my grandson.

252
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,667
Oh, it's very mature reading.

253
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,630
Well, Lord knows I don't
want him falling prey

254
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:41,166
to the liberal down slide.

255
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,597
What is he, eight?

256
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:45,816
Yes, a very impressionable age.

257
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:47,369
So, what do I owe you?

258
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,546
45 dollars and 87 cents please.

259
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:54,719
I have exact change.

260
00:12:55,013 --> 00:12:56,432
Of course you do.

261
00:12:57,817 --> 00:12:59,026
Here it is.

262
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,083
Now, when are you getting married?

263
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:06,333
Ah, well just as soon as I
find Mister Right, Margie.

264
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:07,421
When you stop looking,

265
00:13:07,432 --> 00:13:09,030
that's when you're going to find him.

266
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,667
You know I met Harold
when I was on a train trip

267
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,250
in Europe with my sister, Edna.

268
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:16,875
Oh, that is so romantic.

269
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,875
I met my Steve on a train.

270
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,250
We got married last month.

271
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,125
Thank you for the book, dear.

272
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,625
Really? On a train?

273
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,375
I couldn't resist.

274
00:13:31,386 --> 00:13:33,699
Plus, telling a dinosaur that
you met your husband online,

275
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,458
doesn't have quite the same effect.

276
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:37,789
Now, speaking of which,

277
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,959
can I create an online
dating profile for you?

278
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,333
I don't trust people online.

279
00:13:41,956 --> 00:13:45,333
They lie, and they'll say
anything to get you to meet them,

280
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,125
and then when you do,

281
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,714
it's a big disappointment.

282
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,461
You ever tried it?

283
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:51,834
I don't need to.

284
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,375
I've seen 20/20.

285
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,133
Hold a sec, you and
Brandon have a history.

286
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:56,816
Yeah.

287
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:58,130
Well, he's single now,

288
00:13:58,141 --> 00:13:59,607
and you're kind of whatever,

289
00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:01,439
so why don't you guys pick
up where you left off?

290
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,783
I don't want a relationship.

291
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,709
I'm happy.

292
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,745
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

293
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:10,625
You are in a relationship,
with Brandon,

294
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:13,014
you just don't see it.

295
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,542
You guys go to concerts
and movies together,

296
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,704
you do lunches and dinners,
you're practically best friends,

297
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:21,514
you're just not having sex.

298
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,139
Oh, um,

299
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,959
was he bad in bed?

300
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:40,009
So, great in bed,

301
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,611
and a dear friend,

302
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,542
what's the problem?

303
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,264
Well, he's never shown any
interest in being with me.

304
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:48,834
I don't think that's true.

305
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:50,208
The entire time I've known him,

306
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,125
we've only been together once,

307
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,908
at his house,
and he was still married.

308
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,490
That's my wife.

309
00:14:58,501 --> 00:14:59,531
I know it, don't move.

310
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:00,642
Don't say a word.

311
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:04,444
Wait until I'm out of bed
before you answer that.

312
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:09,750
Hello?

313
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:10,954
Hi.

314
00:15:11,051 --> 00:15:12,117
Hey hon.

315
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:13,615
Guess who caught an early train.

316
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,792
I need you to pick me up.

317
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:15,792
Where are you?

318
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,019
In town at the station.

319
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,113
I love that.

320
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,836
All right, I'll be there in 20.

321
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,125
You went to his house?

322
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,542
That's not like you.

323
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,000
Well, I wasn't as careful
then as I am now.

324
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:46,359
Hello?

325
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,872
I left my earrings there.

326
00:15:47,883 --> 00:15:49,754
Okay, where'd you put them?

327
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:52,856
They're on the nightstand
on your side of the bed.

328
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:53,989
Okay, I got 'em.

329
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,317
What do I do with these?

330
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,740
Do you have a place
you can hide them?

331
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,394
Just give them to me
when I see you again.

332
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:00,322
When Rachel comes home
from a trip, she nests.

333
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,834
She goes through things and
reorganizes everything.

334
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:03,917
All right.

335
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,528
Do you have a gift box?

336
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,375
Yeah, I got one.

337
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:14,981
And a ribbon?

338
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:17,961
I got a bow.

339
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:19,618
Well, if that's all you've got,
then sure.

340
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,041
Hey what am I doing with these?

341
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,041
Put the earrings in the box.

342
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,155
Wait, am I giving your
earrings to my wife as a gift?

343
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,916
And tell her you were
thinking about her

344
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:29,437
while she was gone.

345
00:16:30,838 --> 00:16:32,713
That's probably gonna work.

346
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:33,932
You're the best.

347
00:16:34,096 --> 00:16:35,096
Are we good?

348
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:36,959
Take a breath.

349
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,458
Go get her.

350
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,121
Lucky for him they
were my good earrings.

351
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,291
So that's why you don't go
to their houses anymore?

352
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,959
Well, that's just one reason.

353
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:53,870
I have a delivery
for Veronica Malloy.

354
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:55,917
Who are they from?

355
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,041
Card's inside, sign here please.

356
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,125
Okay.

357
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,012
Thank you.

358
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,709
Hmm, beautiful.

359
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,832
Here, for Steve.

360
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:16,973
What, no likey?

361
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:19,406
Oh, they should be with somebody
who can actually enjoy them.

362
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,750
Okay, thanks, but

363
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:22,458
why aren't you enjoying them?

364
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,542
Because they cause more problems
than they actually solve.

365
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,625
Trust me.

366
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:47,896
Veronica, can I get you
anything else this evening?

367
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,005
What about a creme brulee?

368
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,777
What's the occasion?

369
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,497
Just because.

370
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:54,959
Coming right up.

371
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,125
Thank you.

372
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,250
Hey sweetie.

373
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:08,607
Oh baby.

374
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,041
And what is for dinner?

375
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,500
Smells fantastic.

376
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:16,583
My newest creation, mondiale amore.

377
00:18:17,182 --> 00:18:18,806
Okay.

378
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,542
Oh honey, that is delicious.

379
00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:23,156
Yeah,
I'm gonna put it on the fall menu,

380
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,354
I think the owners are gonna love it.

381
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:27,531
Well they are crazy if they don't.

382
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:33,177
Oh there's what you got for me.

383
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,502
Geez, must have cost you a fortune.

384
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:39,692
Actually, it's a re-gift.

385
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,906
One of Veronica's suitors is
trying to buy her affections.

386
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:45,790
How is our girl?

387
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:46,982
She's fine.

388
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,277
Oh and by the way, the loved
the pastries you sent over.

389
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:52,373
Of course she did,
they were wonderful pastries.

390
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,280
Actually, I'm a little
concerned about her.

391
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,291
Here, wine.

392
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,302
Yes.

393
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,542
I want her to have what we have.

394
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,151
But if she continues down
the road that she's on,

395
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:05,333
she's never gonna find it.

396
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:07,375
You need to be a supportive friend,

397
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,795
and leave her alone,
she needs to find her own way.

398
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:13,561
But why can't she and
Brandon be together?

399
00:19:13,572 --> 00:19:15,840
Come on, they're perfect, they fit.

400
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,333
Don't meddle.

401
00:19:17,877 --> 00:19:19,416
Go get washed up.

402
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:21,848
Dinner is almost ready.

403
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:24,962
Oh and take down the sling,
it's getting dusty.

404
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:27,642
I told my mom it's a hammock.

405
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,127
You're kidding.

406
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,083
I'm not going to Tokyo.

407
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:39,905
I'm sorry, did the deal fall through?

408
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,987
No, everything's still on course,

409
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:45,457
but there are more pressing
issues here at home.

410
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:50,623
Andrea lost her job last week.

411
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:54,748
She's devastated, and I want
to be there for her right now.

412
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:57,460
It's not like we need the money but,

413
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,385
this is something that
was important to her.

414
00:20:06,545 --> 00:20:07,963
You know when we first met

415
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,481
you said you had to be there for her,

416
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:12,307
and now you want to be there.

417
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:13,775
It's nice to hear.

418
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,479
I hope this isn't goodbye.

419
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,625
Nathan, it would make me happy

420
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:20,564
if I never heard from you again.

421
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,603
Gee, thanks.

422
00:20:22,814 --> 00:20:24,364
Honey, if I do it means that there's

423
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,375
something wrong in your marriage,
and you're not fixing it.

424
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:31,971
Affairs are like drugs,
they can become addictive.

425
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,783
But at the base,

426
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,572
you're just using it
to escape problems

427
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,486
that you don't want to face.

428
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,500
I will miss you.

429
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Be happy.

430
00:20:57,445 --> 00:21:01,458
So, Steve introduced me to
something new last night.

431
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:03,875
Trent, we've already
discussed oversharing.

432
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,242
New recipe.

433
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:07,291
Oh, is it good?

434
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,792
Ah, to die for.

435
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,387
I'm telling you,
that man can really cook.

436
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,859
Oh, good morning Adam.

437
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,734
Still straight, Trent.

438
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:18,968
Still married.

439
00:21:20,215 --> 00:21:21,280
For you.

440
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,500
Thank you.

441
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,943
Oh, and I've got something for you.

442
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:29,917
Thank you.

443
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,855
Well, I guess I'll see
you at the next sale?

444
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:35,660
Wait a second.

445
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,430
Aren't you forgetting something?

446
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:39,041
What's that?

447
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,709
You made me a promise.

448
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:41,792
Did I?

449
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:44,682
Really?

450
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:45,984
Remind me.

451
00:21:46,008 --> 00:21:47,924
Well, if I have to remind you,

452
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,542
clearly it's not that
important to you.

453
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,743
I guess you're right.

454
00:21:51,754 --> 00:21:52,868
About what?

455
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:54,918
We met over a year ago,

456
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:57,038
and I've been ridiculous so,

457
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,674
I don't want to bother you anymore.

458
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,460
So?

459
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:03,333
So, I give up.

460
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,615
Well I guess I won't be seeing you

461
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,661
for drinks later tonight.

462
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,667
Okay, and I guess I won't see you

463
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,542
at that bar at 5th and Elm at eight.

464
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,834
Hey, I'm not standing
up here for my health.

465
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:18,479
Oh I'm sorry.

466
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,625
See you later.

467
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:23,792
You know it.

468
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:31,317
Ronnie, you just went through
a breakup two hours ago.

469
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:34,253
Don't you think you need
a little time to heal?

470
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,785
Heal from what?

471
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:38,322
My relationships always
have an expiration date.

472
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,500
It's a matter of when, not if.

473
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,629
And you don't see
anything wrong with that?

474
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,158
Okay, you know what your problem is?

475
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:51,961
You're emotionally claustrophobic.

476
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:54,464
Look,
I'm not looking for a relationship.

477
00:22:55,302 --> 00:22:57,489
Lord knows the drama
that comes with one,

478
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,949
I have right here with you.

479
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:01,198
Oh, okay.

480
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,390
Gorgeous.

481
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:46,542
Thank you.

482
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,792
Sorry I'm late, life.

483
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:51,333
Excuse me, sir.

484
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:52,417
Scotch neat, please.

485
00:23:54,814 --> 00:23:56,439
So, tell me,

486
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:59,345
what changed your mind?

487
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,103
I wasn't available until now.

488
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:05,183
Oh, I see.

489
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:09,083
Well I'm sorry it didn't work out.

490
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:12,614
That's the last lie you're
ever going to tell me.

491
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,543
Thank you.

492
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:18,000
Excuse me.

493
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:19,489
Sure.

494
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:33,035
Are you okay with the
fact that I'm not yours,

495
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,567
and I never will be.

496
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:37,917
I know my place and I'm
comfortable with it.

497
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Else, I wouldn't be here.

498
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:42,231
Cheers?

499
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,799
Cheers.

500
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,231
Are you seeing anyone else?

501
00:24:51,903 --> 00:24:53,570
Aside from my wife?

502
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:54,834
No.

503
00:24:55,837 --> 00:24:57,478
Let me lay it out for you now.

504
00:24:57,489 --> 00:24:59,115
Do, please.

505
00:25:00,078 --> 00:25:02,535
I have been mad about you
since the day we met,

506
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,671
and I can't stop thinking about you.

507
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:07,451
I'm not leaving my wife.

508
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:10,958
But I have to be with you.

509
00:26:32,351 --> 00:26:34,947
You are very quiet this morning.

510
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:39,939
I just wish someone knew
how I really want it to be.

511
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,375
Do tell.

512
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:44,916
Well, I know it sounds selfish but,

513
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,530
there are times when I wish a guy

514
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:48,875
would pay attention to my needs

515
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:51,392
as much as he pays attention to his.

516
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:54,663
So, safe to say that Adam

517
00:26:54,674 --> 00:26:57,319
will only be filling our
shelves from now on.

518
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,260
No, I don't know about that.

519
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,500
Look, what you need,

520
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:04,291
is a guy that isn't
splitting his focus,

521
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:06,679
like Brandon.

522
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,000
Trent, you know me,

523
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:12,650
as soon as I get into a
relationship I push them away.

524
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:15,056
It's how I'm wired, it's who I am.

525
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:17,864
And I don't want to
do that to Brandon.

526
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,375
Well if Brandon is any evidence

527
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,667
of how you push people away,

528
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,041
then you my dear are very bad at it.

529
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,500
I tried, he just wouldn't leave.

530
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,076
He just stuck in there and,

531
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:33,927
I've grown to love our friendship.

532
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:38,250
But that was him, it's all him.

533
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:41,417
So I guess we are back to square one.

534
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:58,796
Well,
can we see this when we're up there?

535
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:01,931
Oh, butterflies.

536
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:05,736
It's gonna add a couple
hours to our trip.

537
00:28:05,747 --> 00:28:07,845
I'm not in any hurry to get back.

538
00:28:09,023 --> 00:28:10,398
All right, we'll see.

539
00:30:41,651 --> 00:30:42,651
Hi.

540
00:30:43,336 --> 00:30:44,836
Hi, sleepy head.

541
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:47,798
Where are we?

542
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,057
Come on, I'll show you.

543
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,137
Oh my God, the butterflies.

544
00:31:08,511 --> 00:31:09,511
Thank you.

545
00:31:11,156 --> 00:31:13,155
Now I feel bad about falling asleep.

546
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:15,120
I wanted to surprise you.

547
00:31:18,612 --> 00:31:21,041
I wonder how many
butterflies come here.

548
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,458
I don't know about that,

549
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:25,706
but at least 100,000
humans come here each year.

550
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:28,253
This is unbelievable.

551
00:31:28,401 --> 00:31:30,628
Did you know that these butterflies

552
00:31:30,661 --> 00:31:33,253
have a lifespan of six months,

553
00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:36,765
whereas the common monarch
only lives for six weeks.

554
00:31:39,017 --> 00:31:40,017
Wow.

555
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,765
Say cheese.

556
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,120
Cheese.

557
00:31:49,672 --> 00:31:50,672
Oh it's pretty.

558
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:52,914
Wow.

559
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:14,250
Hey, your clothes, can we move them?

560
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:15,261
That's my bed.

561
00:32:16,004 --> 00:32:17,296
Sorry.

562
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:18,834
Hey, you hungry?

563
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:19,901
Yeah, I could eat.

564
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:20,537
You want to go out or you want
to get something delivered?

565
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:21,369
Let's order something in,

566
00:32:21,435 --> 00:32:23,721
then we can watch a movie on TV.

567
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,874
Oh, that's a good idea.

568
00:32:25,885 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm sure there's a
pizza place close by.

569
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,321
God, not pizza.

570
00:32:29,332 --> 00:32:31,416
You love pizza.

571
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:33,744
I've eaten a lot lately.

572
00:32:35,606 --> 00:32:36,606
Okay well,

573
00:32:37,445 --> 00:32:40,094
I guess that only
leaves us one option.

574
00:32:56,861 --> 00:32:58,320
Dinner is served.

575
00:33:00,624 --> 00:33:03,115
And don't say anything,
you wanted to see the butterflies,

576
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,708
so that's what you get.

577
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:06,900
Otherwise you would
have been home by now.

578
00:33:06,911 --> 00:33:08,447
Well, it was worth it.

579
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:09,782
I know you're used to fine cuisine

580
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:11,885
at five-star hotels,

581
00:33:11,896 --> 00:33:14,166
but this is as good
as it's gonna get.

582
00:33:14,177 --> 00:33:15,177
What do you got there?

583
00:33:15,188 --> 00:33:16,429
Rollos?

584
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,856
Maybe.

585
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,417
Okay, catch.

586
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,667
Thanks.

587
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:29,446
Can I ask you something?

588
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:31,759
Yeah, anything, what?

589
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,149
I get the VIP treatment,
and the fancy nights out.

590
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:38,917
What do you see in these
guys that you go out with?

591
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,875
Well, they fit into my schedule,

592
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:43,517
and they don't ask questions.

593
00:33:43,765 --> 00:33:45,515
Is that enough for you?

594
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:47,500
Well, it has been so far.

595
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,166
I like my independence,
I liked deciding

596
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,542
what I want to do and when,

597
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:57,290
and I like having the freedom
of not being tied down.

598
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,479
So that's it?

599
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,583
Yeah, that's it.

600
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:01,083
I like my life the way it is.

601
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,667
It's not complicated.

602
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:07,114
And besides the most honest
relationships I've ever had,

603
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:09,333
have been when I've been a mistress.

604
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:10,435
But...

605
00:34:11,529 --> 00:34:14,654
don't you want emotional intimacy?

606
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:18,337
I know you, you have the
most beautiful soul Veronica.

607
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,389
I just don't get it.

608
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,305
I have just learned not to need it.

609
00:34:23,316 --> 00:34:24,690
Besides I have friends for that.

610
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,852
I have Trent, I have you.

611
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:28,001
And I have Steve.

612
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:29,970
So it's all about the
physical with these men?

613
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,376
No, it's about making my life easier.

614
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,458
I don't have to invest.

615
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:36,669
I can walk away when I want to.

616
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,375
Well, that's a pretty
pathetic way to live.

617
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:40,944
I mean sure maybe you don't
get hurt along the way,

618
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:42,562
but years from now?

619
00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:45,155
Don't you judge me,

620
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,834
I mean you fix your insecurities

621
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:49,000
with the occasional woman
who feeds your ego,

622
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:53,250
and I fix mine by not letting
anyone know all about me.

623
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,053
I mean we're basically
doing the same thing,

624
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,291
but in different ways.

625
00:34:57,817 --> 00:34:59,333
And yes, it can get tiresome

626
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:01,924
to always have to
stay on my game but,

627
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,875
beats the alternative.

628
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:05,739
And the alternative is what?

629
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,834
Having a meaningful,
valuable relationship

630
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:09,709
with a man that you're intimate with?

631
00:35:10,929 --> 00:35:14,262
Look I know, I've been
guilty of feeding my ego.

632
00:35:15,341 --> 00:35:18,258
But in the meantime,
I know deep down what I really want.

633
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:19,656
Do you think for a second

634
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,452
there haven't been some
of these one-nighters

635
00:35:21,463 --> 00:35:23,750
that I didn't have some
hope that maybe, just maybe,

636
00:35:23,761 --> 00:35:25,674
I'd meet somebody special?

637
00:35:27,188 --> 00:35:28,188
No.

638
00:35:28,351 --> 00:35:29,934
No?

639
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:32,014
To me,
the alternative's being vulnerable

640
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:34,900
and being vulnerable,
vulnerable people get hurt,

641
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:38,111
and I just don't want
that to happen to me.

642
00:35:39,185 --> 00:35:41,614
And are you really so
deluded that you think

643
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:44,669
that a one-night stand could
be any more than that?

644
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,102
By very definition it's nothing more

645
00:35:46,113 --> 00:35:47,197
than a one-night affair.

646
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,542
I'm not trying to
pick a fight with you.

647
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,931
We just have never had
this discussion before.

648
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,936
I'm just trying to understand.

649
00:35:53,947 --> 00:35:56,739
Chalk it up to being a better friend.

650
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,041
And you're right,

651
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,709
a one-night stand is just that.

652
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,142
I've just never known
anyone like you, that's all.

653
00:36:05,036 --> 00:36:06,537
And since we're sharing,

654
00:36:06,548 --> 00:36:08,693
why don't you tell me the
story about your divorce,

655
00:36:08,704 --> 00:36:10,743
and why haven't you ever told me?

656
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:18,102
Well, we met in photography school,

657
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:20,595
and...

658
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:22,465
as soon as we graduated

659
00:36:22,476 --> 00:36:24,498
we really struggled to find work.

660
00:36:25,502 --> 00:36:27,489
But I just kept feeding
my passion for shooting

661
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,083
landscapes and coastlines,

662
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,417
and in the process I built a career,

663
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,583
but she was still floundering.

664
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:35,959
She couldn't find her voice,
you know?

665
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:38,903
Well that's a dangerous
place for an artist.

666
00:36:38,927 --> 00:36:40,875
And time went on and,

667
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:43,709
I was being published,
and her career was stagnant and,

668
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:47,366
more and more, she just
wouldn't even look at my work,

669
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,583
like she resented me.

670
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,263
I think she fell out of
love with photography,

671
00:36:53,274 --> 00:36:56,700
and in the process,
fell out of love with me also.

672
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:00,614
It's sad.

673
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:02,850
The one thing that brought
the two of you together,

674
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:05,434
is the one thing
that drove you apart.

675
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:14,750
And I didn't tell you because,

676
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:19,630
even though you weren't
the cause of my divorce,

677
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,959
you were definitely a symptom

678
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:27,770
of the erosion of my partnership.

679
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:36,666
What are we gonna watch?

680
00:37:36,677 --> 00:37:37,689
Hitchcock.

681
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,983
Hitchcock, he made a lot of movies.

682
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:42,244
Hitchcock, the movie.

683
00:37:42,575 --> 00:37:44,667
You'll like it.

684
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,041
I think it has nudity in it.

685
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,599
Scooch over.

686
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,750
You ready.

687
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:07,740
<i>Darling, we've watched</i>

688
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,458
<i>the film a hundred times.</i>

689
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:11,031
<i>She doesn't blink.</i>

690
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:12,792
What?

691
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,583
Nothing.

692
00:38:16,136 --> 00:38:17,761
Okay.

693
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,822
What?

694
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:25,595
Nothing, shhh watch the movie.

695
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:37,166
<i>So with very little effort,</i>

696
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,834
<i>and the reflex time
of a garden snail,</i>

697
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:43,417
<i>how does a tortoise's
day compare to ours?</i>

698
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,500
<i>In the time it takes
us to drive 10 miles,</i>

699
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:49,583
<i>the tortoise manages to
move about 100 feet.</i>

700
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,750
<i>While we eat an entire meal,</i>

701
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:54,959
<i>he has nibbled on some vegetation.</i>

702
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,417
<i>And as we spend a day filming
another sequence,</i>

703
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,870
<i>for him, it's time for a nap.</i>

704
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:04,792
<i>The tortoise's way of
making up for that,</i>

705
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,083
<i>isn't to eat more, but to do less.</i>

706
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:44,292
Good morning, sunshine.

707
00:39:44,656 --> 00:39:46,239
Hey.

708
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:48,188
I know you're like a
bear with a sore paw

709
00:39:48,198 --> 00:39:51,072
when you don't get
your caffeine fix so.

710
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,166
Thanks.

711
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:55,720
You know they say this stuff
is actually flammable.

712
00:39:58,291 --> 00:39:59,417
You missed a call.

713
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:01,458
Thanks.

714
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:04,208
Voicemail received.

715
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,458
You should check that.

716
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:09,750
Yeah, I'm just gonna brush my teeth,

717
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:12,583
and then the bathroom's all yours.

718
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:39,583
Okay.

719
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:41,542
You all set?

720
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,380
Why haven't you told me about her?

721
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:47,359
Excuse me.

722
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:48,959
Who's Kristen?

723
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:52,365
She's just a woman I know, why?

724
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:55,234
I think it's a little
bit more than that.

725
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:58,414
Okay.

726
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,667
Seriously, Brandon?

727
00:41:03,132 --> 00:41:05,257
I mean you're not gonna
tell me about her?

728
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:09,252
I knew it, I knew it,
that day in the store

729
00:41:09,263 --> 00:41:10,682
when you picked up that text message,

730
00:41:10,692 --> 00:41:11,818
I knew something was up.

731
00:41:13,161 --> 00:41:14,411
Why couldn't you tell me?

732
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:17,709
What do you want to hear Veronica?

733
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:22,904
I saw a picture of
you and her kissing.

734
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,732
Is this new, how long
has it been going on?

735
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:30,709
So you woke up and
you went to my phone?

736
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:34,125
No Brandon, the phone woke me up,

737
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,542
and I was startled by the picture.

738
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,098
Startled, really?

739
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:41,276
Isn't that a little bit extreme,
Ronnie?

740
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:45,667
To wake up in a bed
that I shared with you

741
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,750
to that picture,

742
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:50,250
you tell me.

743
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:53,739
We didn't share the bed, Ronnie.

744
00:41:54,249 --> 00:41:56,357
We fell asleep watching a movie.

745
00:42:00,507 --> 00:42:01,507
What?

746
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:05,369
Just,

747
00:42:07,835 --> 00:42:10,153
just get me home.

748
00:42:38,738 --> 00:42:40,405
Hi honey.

749
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:42,792
Hey.

750
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:43,500
Welcome home, hotshot.

751
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,000
Oh, thank you, sorry I'm late.

752
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,185
Traffic was hell.

753
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:48,929
Of course.

754
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,333
God I missed you.

755
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,036
Oh, dinner smells great,

756
00:42:57,047 --> 00:42:58,755
and so do you.

757
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,291
What's this?

758
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,959
That is a birthday present
for your grandnephew.

759
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,542
I figured with all the traveling,
you wouldn't have time,

760
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:09,709
so I picked it up for you.

761
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:13,083
Thank you.

762
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:14,563
You are welcome.

763
00:43:15,233 --> 00:43:17,976
Why don't you open up that bottle
of wine right there, do you mind?

764
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:20,195
I tried but I couldn't.

765
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:27,239
So, how was the trip?

766
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:29,671
Got some good shots.

767
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,715
I think the publisher's gonna
like the direction it's going.

768
00:43:32,729 --> 00:43:34,813
Can't wait to see it.

769
00:43:43,565 --> 00:43:44,565
What?

770
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:46,506
Nothing.

771
00:43:50,222 --> 00:43:51,222
Okay.

772
00:43:53,195 --> 00:43:55,903
Would you mind lighting the candles?

773
00:43:56,518 --> 00:43:57,518
Sure.

774
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:00,709
You know how I am with fire.

775
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:17,634
I can't believe that he's been
seeing her for six months,

776
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:20,500
and he's never mentioned
her to me, not a word.

777
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,792
I mean, I mean call me crazy but,

778
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:25,709
when you know someone
that long and that well,

779
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:27,543
doesn't it seem odd,

780
00:44:27,804 --> 00:44:30,887
and why has he never
introduced me to her?

781
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:33,187
I don't care.

782
00:44:35,834 --> 00:44:36,834
Come here.

783
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,250
You are fantastic.

784
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,917
Stay with me tonight.

785
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,250
No.

786
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,375
I'm clear until tomorrow.

787
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:15,332
She's out of town on business.

788
00:45:16,601 --> 00:45:18,226
I can't.

789
00:45:18,872 --> 00:45:21,206
I don't want to get used to this.

790
00:45:23,709 --> 00:45:28,000
Well, I guess that's something
I'll have to get used to.

791
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:37,417
You know there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

792
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,653
I have a client who's
looking for a rare book,

793
00:45:40,664 --> 00:45:42,996
and we can't seem to find it.

794
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:44,155
What is it?

795
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:46,458
It's called the Emerald Whaler,

796
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:50,010
written by William Jr Lowbenstein.

797
00:45:52,022 --> 00:45:53,231
Lubby.

798
00:45:53,304 --> 00:45:54,638
Oh, you've heard of him?

799
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:56,754
Maybe.

800
00:45:58,228 --> 00:46:02,715
Well, I need a first edition,
1960, signed copy.

801
00:46:03,411 --> 00:46:05,403
Can you find that for me?

802
00:46:05,976 --> 00:46:07,934
It'll be rare, expensive,

803
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,333
and if I say yes will
that persuade you

804
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:13,709
to stay with me tonight?

805
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:14,792
No.

806
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:19,762
But it'll make me very happy.

807
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,039
Can I help you find something?

808
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:40,437
Oh hi, yes thank you.

809
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:43,656
Well I'm looking for a book about

810
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,667
dating after divorce.

811
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,500
Hmmm,
well I'm not sure reading a book's

812
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:50,296
really gonna help you.

813
00:46:51,783 --> 00:46:53,945
What would you look for in a man?

814
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:56,250
Well that varies actually.

815
00:46:57,709 --> 00:47:00,265
But he doesn't have to be
a saint though, does he?

816
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,715
I tell you what, why don't you
make me a list of attributes

817
00:47:03,726 --> 00:47:07,234
that I might possess,
which will be attractive to a woman,

818
00:47:07,245 --> 00:47:09,328
such as yourself.

819
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:13,166
Trent.

820
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,598
Need your help.

821
00:47:14,638 --> 00:47:16,291
Someone will come and help you.

822
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,000
I can wait until you're through.

823
00:47:19,114 --> 00:47:20,247
I'm sorry.

824
00:47:20,258 --> 00:47:22,364
No it's just that I've
been married for 30 years,

825
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:24,934
and now, newly single.

826
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:28,638
Well, being a gentleman
never goes out of style,

827
00:47:28,649 --> 00:47:32,879
and women love honesty.

828
00:47:34,814 --> 00:47:35,970
Brandon?

829
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:36,832
Hey.

830
00:47:36,843 --> 00:47:37,843
Hi Trent.

831
00:47:42,588 --> 00:47:44,004
What?

832
00:47:44,015 --> 00:47:46,012
Let me take care of this guy.

833
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:47,291
Why?

834
00:47:47,302 --> 00:47:48,677
He's cute, he's single,

835
00:47:48,688 --> 00:47:50,615
I thought you'd be thrilled
that I'm talking to him.

836
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:51,426
He's gay.

837
00:47:51,437 --> 00:47:52,437
No.

838
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,625
Trust me.

839
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,542
He is?

840
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:58,238
I know it.

841
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,215
Worked it out with Brandon,
he's cuter.

842
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:03,957
Fine.

843
00:48:09,709 --> 00:48:10,709
Hey.

844
00:48:12,247 --> 00:48:13,247
Seriously?

845
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,291
You pitch a fit up in Pismo

846
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,041
and now you're not taking my calls.

847
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,125
That sounds about right.

848
00:48:19,722 --> 00:48:22,333
Ronnie, clearly you're upset,
but I haven't a clue--

849
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:23,959
Don't you understand why I'm upset?

850
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:26,750
Please, please, tell me what exactly

851
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm dealing with here.

852
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:30,125
You lied to me, you kept secrets.

853
00:48:30,136 --> 00:48:31,041
I lied?

854
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:32,125
What did I lie about?

855
00:48:33,054 --> 00:48:36,292
Okay, I haven't mentioned
Kristen to you, but lied?

856
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:37,875
It's a lie by omission.

857
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:39,041
A what?

858
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:42,273
If you lead someone
to believe one thing,

859
00:48:42,284 --> 00:48:43,740
based on your words and your actions

860
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,834
and then it turns out to be
something completely different,

861
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:48,542
that's a lie.

862
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,333
I still don't get it.

863
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:51,667
Of course you don't.

864
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:54,750
I didn't lie, I just didn't tell you.

865
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:57,660
Yeah, well that's just
guys' slight of hand.

866
00:48:58,301 --> 00:48:59,333
Where am I going?

867
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:00,816
Goodbye Brandon.

868
00:49:02,278 --> 00:49:03,579
We're not done here.

869
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:04,805
Yes we are.

870
00:49:05,788 --> 00:49:07,152
I'll call you later.

871
00:49:08,985 --> 00:49:11,409
He didn't technically lie to you.

872
00:49:11,934 --> 00:49:13,899
Don't you start now.

873
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:16,333
Veronica,
he doesn't owe you anything.

874
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:18,792
He owes me respect.

875
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:22,000
I couldn't care less that
he's seeing somebody,

876
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:23,697
but hiding it from me?

877
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:25,959
Telling somebody that
you've never lied,

878
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:28,333
just because someone hasn't
asked a specific question,

879
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:30,723
doesn't somehow make the truth.

880
00:49:39,797 --> 00:49:42,542
Wasn't Trent fantastic
the other night?

881
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:43,625
Oh, the show was great.

882
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:45,542
I'm so proud of you.

883
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:47,417
Thank you, not too blue?

884
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,542
No.

885
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,387
Well, you did push the
envelope a little bit,

886
00:49:51,398 --> 00:49:53,414
but yeah, it was really good.

887
00:49:53,425 --> 00:49:55,773
Why didn't you do your bit
about the royal family?

888
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,041
Well I like to think
I have a little more

889
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,542
originality than that.

890
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:00,458
Huh.

891
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:02,000
Huh?

892
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:03,375
You know I was laughing so much

893
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,792
I had tears rolling down my cheeks.

894
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:06,750
Really?

895
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:08,583
You know you should do more comedy.

896
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:10,709
I think you may have
missed your calling.

897
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,472
Maybe I will.

898
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:19,010
Still not speaking with him?

899
00:50:19,073 --> 00:50:19,784
No.

900
00:50:19,795 --> 00:50:21,416
- Who?
- Brandon.

901
00:50:21,908 --> 00:50:23,364
What did he do now?

902
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:25,375
Well he didn't do anything wrong.

903
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:27,440
You tell it, what did he do?

904
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:31,250
Is a lie by omission a lie,
or is it the truth?

905
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,208
But there's no truth in a lie.

906
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:36,750
But it's not a lie if no
one actually said anything.

907
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:38,276
Schschm...

908
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:41,823
Is what Brandon didn't tell you,

909
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:45,472
not said maybe to
spare your feelings?

910
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,125
Look it doesn't matter how I feel.

911
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:49,625
I thought we were closer than that,

912
00:50:49,709 --> 00:50:52,000
I thought we could tell
each other everything.

913
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:56,625
Now I, I don't trust him anymore.

914
00:50:57,336 --> 00:51:00,182
Bring me up to speed here.

915
00:51:00,552 --> 00:51:02,114
Okay, here's what happened.

916
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,366
Ronnie found out that Brandon
has been seeing someone.

917
00:51:04,377 --> 00:51:05,245
So?

918
00:51:05,256 --> 00:51:06,964
For over six months?

919
00:51:07,168 --> 00:51:10,460
Oh honey, he has feelings for you.

920
00:51:10,475 --> 00:51:12,940
He's been single for
almost five years.

921
00:51:12,959 --> 00:51:14,948
He's never made a move on me.

922
00:51:14,959 --> 00:51:17,448
He's never even offered
me any kind of affection,

923
00:51:17,459 --> 00:51:19,327
other than friendship.

924
00:51:19,338 --> 00:51:21,445
And we've always had this
open line of communication

925
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:23,500
when it comes to dating.

926
00:51:23,511 --> 00:51:26,595
I mean, we practically
tell each other everything.

927
00:51:26,606 --> 00:51:29,690
So you were closer with
Brandon than anyone else?

928
00:51:29,701 --> 00:51:31,070
Don't you think it's kind of odd

929
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,291
that you haven't
found a relationship?

930
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:37,166
Maybe he's just filling the gap
of what you expect from men?

931
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,625
Look, we all know, everyone knows,

932
00:51:39,636 --> 00:51:41,929
that the two of you have
feelings for each other.

933
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,834
Maybe he didn't tell
you about the girl

934
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:45,458
because he knew it would affect you.

935
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:48,083
No, I would have been
fine if he'd told me.

936
00:51:49,529 --> 00:51:51,779
Really, I want him to be happy.

937
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:53,073
Then why are you ignoring his calls

938
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:54,674
instead of celebrating with him.

939
00:51:54,705 --> 00:51:56,484
Let's do a little survey shall we?

940
00:51:56,495 --> 00:51:57,834
Oh yes, let's.

941
00:51:57,845 --> 00:51:59,303
Mm-hmmm.

942
00:51:59,314 --> 00:52:02,356
When you're not with Brandon,
do you think about him?

943
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:03,583
Yes.

944
00:52:04,484 --> 00:52:06,109
But I also think about Trent.

945
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:07,875
Okay, fair enough.

946
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:13,000
Where did Brandon have
lunch last Monday?

947
00:52:13,512 --> 00:52:14,987
Piccolo Paradisio.

948
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,731
Where did Trent have lunch yesterday?

949
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:22,041
I didn't have lunch,
I stayed in the store, remember?

950
00:52:23,158 --> 00:52:24,377
I've got one.

951
00:52:24,388 --> 00:52:26,721
Who do you call when you
need help with something?

952
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:27,959
Brandon.

953
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:30,440
Mm-hmm, and yet I'm closer.

954
00:52:30,854 --> 00:52:32,843
Do you answer his texts

955
00:52:32,854 --> 00:52:34,417
when you're with someone else?

956
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,875
Sometimes, it depends.

957
00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:37,125
Mm-hmm, depends.

958
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:39,542
Where does Brandon get his hair cut?

959
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:41,276
Oh, the Last Tango.

960
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:42,960
Karen's been his girl for years.

961
00:52:42,971 --> 00:52:44,959
Where does Trent get his hair cut?

962
00:52:45,702 --> 00:52:47,114
I cut his hair.

963
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:47,834
I knew that.

964
00:52:47,917 --> 00:52:49,375
Bullshit.

965
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,583
Can he answer all those
questions about you?

966
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:54,031
Um, most of them, but probably not

967
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:56,208
where I get my hair cut.

968
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:58,667
I rest my case.

969
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,375
You say that you want
Brandon to be happy,

970
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:05,135
but you are the one that wants
to make him feel that way.

971
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:11,103
See, he's not just a great cook,
he's also a genius.

972
00:53:11,114 --> 00:53:12,144
Genius.

973
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,489
Genius.

974
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,223
You keep pushing him away
and you're gonna lose him.

975
00:53:24,164 --> 00:53:25,581
It's about time.

976
00:53:26,534 --> 00:53:28,174
I know, I'm sorry.

977
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:31,583
Can I come by so we can talk?

978
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,401
Sure, I'm in.

979
00:53:44,949 --> 00:53:46,241
Please, come in.

980
00:53:56,086 --> 00:53:58,006
Can I get you anything?

981
00:53:59,062 --> 00:54:00,687
Do you have some wine?

982
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,740
I think I do.

983
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:18,417
Here, open this will you?

984
00:54:18,428 --> 00:54:20,166
I'll get some wine glasses.

985
00:54:20,177 --> 00:54:21,260
All right.

986
00:54:31,331 --> 00:54:32,737
Nice work.

987
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:35,471
Thank you.

988
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,793
Thank you.

989
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:44,381
I'm here.

990
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:49,936
I have to come clean
with you about something.

991
00:54:51,395 --> 00:54:52,943
And I need your help.

992
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:57,917
All right.

993
00:54:59,603 --> 00:55:01,020
Is that all I get?

994
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,989
I'm not sure what it is
you've come here to say.

995
00:55:05,834 --> 00:55:08,375
First of all,
I am sorry that I reacted

996
00:55:08,386 --> 00:55:09,517
the way I did in Pismo.

997
00:55:09,528 --> 00:55:11,357
I mean that was a nice trip.

998
00:55:11,882 --> 00:55:13,632
I felt like I ruined it.

999
00:55:17,623 --> 00:55:19,289
And second?

1000
00:55:27,709 --> 00:55:30,250
I have hard alcohol if
that'll make this easier.

1001
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:32,750
Brandon don't joke,
this is hard enough as it is.

1002
00:55:32,834 --> 00:55:33,834
I see that.

1003
00:55:36,922 --> 00:55:39,047
I don't know where to start.

1004
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,504
You're the only person that
I can talk to about this,

1005
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,868
and yet at the same time
you're the only one I can't.

1006
00:55:43,879 --> 00:55:45,583
Oh Ronnie, it's okay.

1007
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:47,568
You're safe with me.

1008
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,474
My anger came from jealousy.

1009
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:56,951
And it's not right, it's not me and,

1010
00:55:58,451 --> 00:56:03,232
I don't want to feel the way
that I feel about you and,

1011
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:07,646
and I want you to help
make those feeling go away.

1012
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:09,417
What feelings?

1013
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,059
The ones that make
me want to kiss you,

1014
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,341
when I look at you sometimes.

1015
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,041
I'm trying to understand why

1016
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:23,125
you need those feelings to disappear.

1017
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:25,625
Because they're not right, or fair,

1018
00:56:25,709 --> 00:56:27,458
or safe for me to have them.

1019
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:29,052
What are you afraid of?

1020
00:56:29,063 --> 00:56:30,063
Losing.

1021
00:56:30,074 --> 00:56:31,074
Me?

1022
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,160
No, me.

1023
00:56:36,513 --> 00:56:39,014
Hold that thought.

1024
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:41,474
In here, honey.

1025
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:43,917
I am such a dip,

1026
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,667
I can't find my phone.

1027
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:49,625
Hi.

1028
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:51,007
Hello.

1029
00:56:51,146 --> 00:56:52,959
Honey, this is Veronica.

1030
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:55,169
Veronica, meet Kristen.

1031
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:56,333
Oh my God.

1032
00:56:56,417 --> 00:56:58,779
It's so nice to finally meet you,

1033
00:56:59,854 --> 00:57:01,896
and I'm sorry I'm in such a rush.

1034
00:57:01,907 --> 00:57:03,533
Oh, here it is.

1035
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:05,798
And I'm late, I gotta go.

1036
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:07,045
Nice to meet you, Kristen.

1037
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:08,083
Nice meeting you too.

1038
00:57:08,166 --> 00:57:09,375
Okay, great, drive safe.

1039
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:11,792
Let me know when you get there,
please.

1040
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:13,155
He's always making me check in.

1041
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,331
See you later.

1042
00:57:19,253 --> 00:57:20,878
Wow.

1043
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,818
Living together in
less than six months.

1044
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,500
What?

1045
00:57:30,709 --> 00:57:31,709
Nothing.

1046
00:57:31,883 --> 00:57:33,799
- Okay.
- What?

1047
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:36,977
Nothing, I think I should go.

1048
00:57:37,008 --> 00:57:39,709
No, hold on a second.

1049
00:57:39,792 --> 00:57:43,166
You want me to believe you
have these feelings for me,

1050
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,500
but for a whole week
you've been cold,

1051
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:48,296
unkind, and ignore me to the point

1052
00:57:48,307 --> 00:57:50,418
that I thought you never
wanted to speak to me again.

1053
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:53,512
You have a very strange way of
showing your heart, Veronica.

1054
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
You know me

1055
00:57:56,917 --> 00:57:58,750
better than anyone else.

1056
00:57:59,816 --> 00:58:03,633
But I don't want to have
these feelings for anybody,

1057
00:58:03,959 --> 00:58:05,208
let alone you.

1058
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:07,500
And then to have your
girlfriend thrust in my face,

1059
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:09,125
it completely broadsided me.

1060
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:11,041
I didn't even know how to act.

1061
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:13,375
And you really want these
feelings to just go away?

1062
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:14,959
Yes, desperately.

1063
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:19,875
And if Kristen wasn't in the picture,

1064
00:58:19,959 --> 00:58:21,041
would you feel differently?

1065
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:23,500
I don't know. She is--

1066
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,646
When has that ever mattered to you?

1067
00:58:32,892 --> 00:58:34,518
Oh that's not fair.

1068
00:58:34,529 --> 00:58:36,862
I have so much more to lose.

1069
00:58:39,471 --> 00:58:40,471
Do you?

1070
00:59:13,709 --> 00:59:15,500
Oh make love to me.

1071
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:17,417
Please.

1072
01:02:01,668 --> 01:02:03,387
Call you tomorrow?

1073
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:05,535
I'll be at the store.

1074
01:02:16,375 --> 01:02:17,500
Goodnight.

1075
01:02:18,965 --> 01:02:20,175
Goodnight.

1076
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,449
I know you want to make more room,

1077
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,375
but we could store most
of these in the back,

1078
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:43,698
and you could sell them online.

1079
01:02:43,709 --> 01:02:45,583
They're all going to
the local libraries.

1080
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:46,667
Even better.

1081
01:02:49,913 --> 01:02:51,820
What time do you have?

1082
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Quarter to four.

1083
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:56,171
What?

1084
01:02:59,917 --> 01:03:01,709
Take these out please.

1085
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:02,792
Okay.

1086
01:03:13,729 --> 01:03:16,350
Ronnie, Brandon's on line one.

1087
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:25,967
Hi.

1088
01:03:26,047 --> 01:03:27,339
Hey.

1089
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:29,865
I was wondering when you might call.

1090
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:32,506
Yeah, I'm sorry I just got out
of a meeting with my publisher.

1091
01:03:32,537 --> 01:03:35,542
Oh well, I've been busy, it's fine.

1092
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:36,751
How did it go?

1093
01:03:36,762 --> 01:03:41,125
I'm not convinced they're in love with the
concept of my new book, but such is life.

1094
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:42,333
Wasn't it just a scout?

1095
01:03:42,344 --> 01:03:44,418
Yeah yeah, and I did a tap
dance to put them at ease,

1096
01:03:44,428 --> 01:03:47,364
but I'm definitely gonna
have to go back up north

1097
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:48,959
and give them some new looks.

1098
01:03:49,041 --> 01:03:50,166
Sooner, rather than later.

1099
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,208
Anyway, so what's new?

1100
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:54,959
Um, nothing.

1101
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,125
Just today.

1102
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,808
Oh,
I told my agent I'd get back to him

1103
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:00,083
after my meeting.

1104
01:04:00,094 --> 01:04:01,434
Can I reach out to you later

1105
01:04:01,445 --> 01:04:03,112
about us maybe getting together?

1106
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:05,030
Whatever works.

1107
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,584
Okay great, chat soon.

1108
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:33,583
Veronica.

1109
01:04:33,667 --> 01:04:34,933
Hi, Ian.

1110
01:04:34,944 --> 01:04:36,832
Haven't seen you in a while.

1111
01:04:36,843 --> 01:04:37,864
You miss me?

1112
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,709
How much is it, 17 something?

1113
01:04:41,179 --> 01:04:43,262
Yeah, $17.63.

1114
01:04:43,273 --> 01:04:44,273
Keep it.

1115
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:11,959
Hello.

1116
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,166
Sorry about this afternoon.

1117
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:15,513
It's fine.

1118
01:05:15,524 --> 01:05:16,604
What's up?

1119
01:05:16,615 --> 01:05:18,984
I just remembered Trent's
thing is tomorrow night.

1120
01:05:18,995 --> 01:05:20,458
It is.

1121
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,959
I've already cleared my schedule so,

1122
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:24,500
where and when am I meeting you?

1123
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:26,542
Just meet me at the store,
we'll go from there.

1124
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:27,625
Sounds good.

1125
01:05:27,983 --> 01:05:28,934
Okay.

1126
01:05:28,945 --> 01:05:30,448
See you there.

1127
01:05:39,959 --> 01:05:41,699
Who here is planning
tonight after the show

1128
01:05:41,709 --> 01:05:42,834
to go home and have sex?

1129
01:05:42,845 --> 01:05:44,435
Just, show of hands.

1130
01:05:45,452 --> 01:05:47,250
Okay, no one, really?

1131
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:50,333
All right, so you guys are all
like me then, you're married?

1132
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:53,166
Okay, what is it about marriage?

1133
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,333
It absolutely kills your sex life.

1134
01:05:55,417 --> 01:05:56,417
Careful.

1135
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:00,250
Careful, somebody want to
give me a ride home tonight?

1136
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:01,875
I might need one.

1137
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:04,250
Um, another thing that
really gets in the way

1138
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:06,542
of peoples' sex lives, is pets.

1139
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:08,542
Yeah, have you ever noticed that when

1140
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:10,041
there's an animal in the room,

1141
01:06:10,052 --> 01:06:12,088
it's almost impossible to
keep your mind in the game?

1142
01:06:12,098 --> 01:06:13,949
Right? It's kind of
distracting and creepy,

1143
01:06:13,959 --> 01:06:15,041
'cause they watch.

1144
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:16,949
I will kill you bitch
if you tell that story.

1145
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,917
Oh you've said that so many times.

1146
01:06:19,466 --> 01:06:21,365
So tonight, and they're
giving me the light now,

1147
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:22,542
it's time for me to go.

1148
01:06:22,553 --> 01:06:23,887
I'm gonna go home with my husband

1149
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:26,083
and we're going to
have some ice cream,

1150
01:06:26,166 --> 01:06:29,583
and get into our PJ's,
and watch the Golden Girls.

1151
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:31,716
And not have sex.

1152
01:06:31,727 --> 01:06:33,336
All right, I'm Trent Masterson,
goodnight everyone.

1153
01:06:33,346 --> 01:06:34,455
Thank you.

1154
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:41,625
Yeah, he did.

1155
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,625
I am really glad that he
brought that animal bit

1156
01:06:46,709 --> 01:06:48,583
back into the act.

1157
01:06:48,667 --> 01:06:50,417
Come on,
everyone's had that experience

1158
01:06:50,428 --> 01:06:51,489
once or twice, right?

1159
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,250
Tell them about the moray eel.

1160
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:54,375
Oh no no, that hurt.

1161
01:06:54,401 --> 01:06:56,699
No, you've had that happen, right?

1162
01:06:56,709 --> 01:06:57,542
Come on Brandon.

1163
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:59,583
Oh you don't have to answer that.

1164
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:00,750
Don't worry, I won't.

1165
01:07:04,656 --> 01:07:06,500
Kristen's sorry she
couldn't be here tonight,

1166
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:07,981
she really wanted to come.

1167
01:07:07,992 --> 01:07:10,125
Well, you all just have
to come to the next one.

1168
01:07:10,136 --> 01:07:11,145
It's a date.

1169
01:07:11,156 --> 01:07:11,896
Great.

1170
01:07:11,907 --> 01:07:13,239
Who wants more wine?

1171
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:14,250
Yes please.

1172
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,834
She's looking good, isn't she?

1173
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:20,875
Yes, she is.

1174
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:23,959
So glad you guys made up.

1175
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:27,542
Steven, where do I find
your bottle opener?

1176
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:28,699
Second drawer on the left,

1177
01:07:28,709 --> 01:07:30,125
right by the stove.

1178
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:31,208
Second drawer down.

1179
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:33,319
Got it.

1180
01:07:34,317 --> 01:07:37,693
So, Brandon, do you know where
Veronica gets her hair cut?

1181
01:07:37,892 --> 01:07:39,803
I can't say that I do, why?

1182
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:41,458
Just wondering.

1183
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,200
Oh crap!

1184
01:07:44,534 --> 01:07:45,695
What, you all right?

1185
01:07:45,706 --> 01:07:48,375
Yeah, I will be.

1186
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:50,592
I'd better give her a hand.

1187
01:07:54,294 --> 01:07:56,419
I broke the cork.

1188
01:07:58,193 --> 01:07:59,775
Let me help.

1189
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,221
Wa la.

1190
01:08:08,232 --> 01:08:10,033
Show-off.

1191
01:08:23,054 --> 01:08:25,804
Thanks for including me tonight,
that was fun.

1192
01:08:28,463 --> 01:08:30,580
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.

1193
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:32,208
What's wrong?

1194
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,375
Nothing.

1195
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:39,041
Okay.

1196
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,125
Okay?

1197
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:41,208
Forget it.

1198
01:09:02,917 --> 01:09:05,041
I don't think I can do this.

1199
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:06,166
Do what?

1200
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,500
This, us.

1201
01:09:10,959 --> 01:09:12,596
It's not fun anymore.

1202
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:19,375
Did I not just tell you
what a good time I had?

1203
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:22,208
Yeah, in words, but your
actions didn't show it.

1204
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,709
My actions?

1205
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:25,125
What are you talking about?

1206
01:09:26,124 --> 01:09:28,708
I don't want to play this game.

1207
01:09:28,792 --> 01:09:30,625
I'm sorry, you've lost me.

1208
01:09:31,924 --> 01:09:33,155
I don't think we're capable

1209
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:35,283
of going back to where we were.

1210
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,551
What's different?

1211
01:09:37,562 --> 01:09:38,979
Seriously?

1212
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,333
Is this about what
happened the other night?

1213
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:45,750
Partly, but mostly it's about you.

1214
01:09:45,928 --> 01:09:47,011
It's about me?

1215
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:51,510
Please, just dumb it down
for just a little bit.

1216
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,500
I opened up my heart to you,

1217
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:58,328
and basically all I got
was a sexual thank you.

1218
01:10:00,837 --> 01:10:03,102
So it was about the other night.

1219
01:10:05,521 --> 01:10:07,650
I thought if anyone was
mature enough to handle that

1220
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,702
it was gonna be you.

1221
01:10:09,848 --> 01:10:11,823
You're the one that
changed Brandon, not me.

1222
01:10:11,834 --> 01:10:13,625
Oh really?

1223
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,291
What's changed Veronica?

1224
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,625
This, this is what's changed.

1225
01:10:20,922 --> 01:10:24,172
Our friendship just doesn't
seem natural anymore.

1226
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:26,407
You put me in a position
of being a mistress

1227
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:30,339
without the respect that
I've come to deserve.

1228
01:10:32,184 --> 01:10:34,823
Well,
I'm not gonna be your plaything.

1229
01:10:35,121 --> 01:10:37,478
We've got to communicate,

1230
01:10:39,476 --> 01:10:42,987
I just don't know where I
fit in your life anymore.

1231
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:44,458
I'm in a relationship.

1232
01:10:44,542 --> 01:10:46,208
What do you want from me?

1233
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:48,198
Not a god damn thing.

1234
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,286
You know but now we're here.

1235
01:10:51,297 --> 01:10:53,159
I mean I'm just curious,

1236
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:54,918
what sort of a lie did you tell her

1237
01:10:54,928 --> 01:10:56,667
so you could spend
the evening with me?

1238
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,959
I don't have to lie
to the people I love.

1239
01:11:00,192 --> 01:11:02,693
Well, now I know where
I fit in then, don't I?

1240
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:04,171
We had a good time Veronica,

1241
01:11:04,182 --> 01:11:05,382
that's never been our problem.

1242
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:08,083
Your maintaining has
been our disconnect.

1243
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:09,834
You don't know what love is.

1244
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:13,041
You pretend to be a fairy
godmother sprinkling fix-it dust

1245
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:14,542
from married guy to married guy,

1246
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:17,083
so you can stomach the
lifestyle you've chosen.

1247
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:20,625
You're a lonely, desperate
empty soul, who has no idea

1248
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:23,522
how to have a transparent
and honest relationship.

1249
01:11:23,533 --> 01:11:24,433
Go to hell.

1250
01:11:24,444 --> 01:11:26,000
See you there.

1251
01:11:26,083 --> 01:11:28,834
Well, you certainly don't disappoint.

1252
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:31,600
What can is say,
I learn from the best.

1253
01:11:32,225 --> 01:11:36,772
So I guess we're done then,
aren't we?

1254
01:11:36,783 --> 01:11:38,225
Then we're done.

1255
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,062
Hey, how's everyone doing?

1256
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:47,333
Yeah, good, all right.

1257
01:13:47,417 --> 01:13:48,740
Awesome, great,
well I've gotta be honest,

1258
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:50,458
I'm actually a little bit anxious.

1259
01:13:50,542 --> 01:13:54,083
Yeah, I've got a high
school reunion coming up,

1260
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:56,617
and I don't want to
say which one it is,

1261
01:13:56,628 --> 01:13:58,323
because that would be a
little bit depressing,

1262
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,484
but I will say that

1263
01:13:59,495 --> 01:14:01,407
the president of the
United States at the time.

1264
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:02,500
Lincoln.

1265
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:04,333
No, no no, not Lincoln you asshole.

1266
01:14:04,417 --> 01:14:07,834
No, Mister Jimmy Carter, good guy.

1267
01:14:07,917 --> 01:14:09,333
And I was reminded of this recently,

1268
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:10,953
because I was going through
a bunch of old stuff,

1269
01:14:10,963 --> 01:14:12,864
and I found that presidential

1270
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:14,917
physical fitness award that I got.

1271
01:14:15,281 --> 01:14:16,447
Remember those?

1272
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:17,935
You had to do like a million pushups,
a million chin-ups,

1273
01:14:17,945 --> 01:14:19,596
and you had to run really fast,
and you got an award.

1274
01:14:19,606 --> 01:14:21,917
I was shocked that I got
a physical fitness award,

1275
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,083
but I was really good at
running away from bullies,

1276
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:26,667
and I usually got away.

1277
01:14:28,208 --> 01:14:30,291
I'm a little bit nervous
about seeing the bullies

1278
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:31,709
at the reunion,

1279
01:14:31,792 --> 01:14:34,041
but I figure by now they're
all probably divorced

1280
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:35,667
and just driving for Uber.

1281
01:14:36,986 --> 01:14:39,280
One of the bullies who was
on the football team, and I,

1282
01:14:39,291 --> 01:14:41,291
made out underneath the bleachers.

1283
01:14:42,188 --> 01:14:44,875
Yeah, and thus started
my illustrious career

1284
01:14:44,959 --> 01:14:46,125
as a blackmailer.

1285
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:48,792
Yeah, oh yeah, I worked it.

1286
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:51,375
I was the first nerd in that school

1287
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:55,667
to get a jock to give me his
lunch money, and a hand job.

1288
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:57,814
And that was the day
I lost my virginity.

1289
01:14:57,825 --> 01:14:58,959
Goodnight everyone.

1290
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:01,041
Thank you.

1291
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:16,094
I'm gonna go find Trent.

1292
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:18,250
Hi.

1293
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,125
What are you doing here?

1294
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:22,166
I got an email Trent
was doing a show,

1295
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:23,375
and I figured you'd be here.

1296
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:25,550
So I am.

1297
01:15:27,834 --> 01:15:29,625
Ronnie, I hate how things ended.

1298
01:15:29,709 --> 01:15:30,716
Can we talk?

1299
01:15:30,727 --> 01:15:31,739
About what?

1300
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:33,000
Seriously?

1301
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:35,875
I think I've heard everything
I want to hear, from you.

1302
01:15:35,959 --> 01:15:38,834
Look, I feel awful about
some of the things I said,

1303
01:15:38,917 --> 01:15:41,417
it wasn't fair,
and I wanted to apologize.

1304
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:43,333
So, go ahead.

1305
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:46,208
Oh, I can see this is gonna be fun.

1306
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,333
All right,

1307
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,208
when we were together,

1308
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:54,375
I didn't know how to react.

1309
01:15:55,142 --> 01:15:57,323
I mean I'm in a relationship,
I'm living with someone,

1310
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:58,999
and then you and I,

1311
01:16:01,374 --> 01:16:03,239
and it felt right,

1312
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,958
and I know somehow it did for you,
too.

1313
01:16:07,398 --> 01:16:09,698
It doesn't matter how I feel,
you have Kristen.

1314
01:16:09,709 --> 01:16:11,069
It shouldn't matter to you, either.

1315
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:13,125
Take her out of the
equation for a minute.

1316
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:14,792
I can't, and neither can you.

1317
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:15,851
Try.

1318
01:16:15,862 --> 01:16:17,520
I am not gonna have
this conversation now,

1319
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,148
and especially not here.

1320
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:20,743
Fine.

1321
01:16:29,927 --> 01:16:31,042
This better?

1322
01:16:33,846 --> 01:16:36,463
When I lashed out at you,
I said that if anyone

1323
01:16:36,545 --> 01:16:38,875
was mature enough to
handle what happened,

1324
01:16:38,959 --> 01:16:40,358
it would be you.

1325
01:16:40,834 --> 01:16:42,976
The problem was, I couldn't.

1326
01:16:42,987 --> 01:16:44,693
Look, you've already shown
me that you don't love me,

1327
01:16:44,703 --> 01:16:46,667
you don't have to keep proving it.

1328
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:48,458
Well, that's where you're wrong.

1329
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:50,166
I need your help here.

1330
01:16:50,177 --> 01:16:51,489
I know you don't want commitment,

1331
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,428
I know you don't want
to be domesticated.

1332
01:16:53,439 --> 01:16:54,519
Kristen wants those things,

1333
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:56,291
I didn't think you of all people

1334
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:57,446
would want me to give that up.

1335
01:16:57,456 --> 01:16:58,782
Why do you keep telling me this

1336
01:16:58,792 --> 01:17:00,583
if you have no intention
of being with me?

1337
01:17:00,667 --> 01:17:02,240
I have no intentions
of being with you?

1338
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,450
Well, now you're being stupid.

1339
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:07,000
Okay,
let me tell you how this is done.

1340
01:17:08,483 --> 01:17:10,075
Remember when my father got sick

1341
01:17:10,086 --> 01:17:12,114
and I had to fly to Chicago?

1342
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:13,834
Of course, how can I forget?

1343
01:17:13,917 --> 01:17:16,041
And you came by to pick
me up for the airport?

1344
01:17:16,125 --> 01:17:17,291
And I was a wreck,

1345
01:17:17,302 --> 01:17:18,594
and I hadn't packed a god damn thing,

1346
01:17:18,604 --> 01:17:20,425
except a pair of dirty
socks and a toothbrush,

1347
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:22,747
and you came in,
and you calmed me down,

1348
01:17:22,758 --> 01:17:24,078
and you helped me get it together,

1349
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:25,735
and I saw compassion in you

1350
01:17:25,746 --> 01:17:27,497
that I had never seen
in anyone before.

1351
01:17:28,707 --> 01:17:30,352
And when I was back there,
you stayed in touch with me

1352
01:17:30,362 --> 01:17:31,239
every step of the way.

1353
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,875
You were right there by my side,

1354
01:17:32,886 --> 01:17:34,037
even though we were so far apart,

1355
01:17:34,047 --> 01:17:35,661
and the whole time I was gone,

1356
01:17:35,672 --> 01:17:37,375
all I could think
about was this angel

1357
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:39,000
that made me feel safe and secure

1358
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:40,417
through those vulnerable moments,

1359
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,750
and I felt assured that
life was gonna be okay,

1360
01:17:42,834 --> 01:17:45,289
and that's when I
fell in love with you.

1361
01:17:47,508 --> 01:17:49,375
How could you never tell me that?

1362
01:17:49,458 --> 01:17:51,422
I didn't think you were ready.

1363
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:54,917
Veronica we both know
that you know how to act

1364
01:17:54,928 --> 01:17:56,287
like you're feeling something,

1365
01:17:56,298 --> 01:17:58,585
but you don't really truly feel.

1366
01:17:58,709 --> 01:18:00,809
Brandon, I am so invested in us,

1367
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:02,781
that I could never walk away.

1368
01:18:05,141 --> 01:18:06,291
So I'm afraid.

1369
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:07,500
Afraid of what?

1370
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:09,000
Of failing, of letting you down,

1371
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:12,266
I don't know how to have
that kind of a relationship.

1372
01:18:12,375 --> 01:18:14,500
Just let your guard down,

1373
01:18:14,583 --> 01:18:16,280
and allow me to love you.

1374
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:18,094
I did.

1375
01:18:19,581 --> 01:18:21,656
And then everything changed.

1376
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:28,250
So, where do we go from here?

1377
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:30,211
I've got to break
it off with Kristen.

1378
01:18:30,258 --> 01:18:32,216
No, no.

1379
01:18:32,994 --> 01:18:35,323
You think it's okay that while
I'm sharing a bed with her,

1380
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:37,417
I'm telling somebody else
that I'm in love with them?

1381
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,788
You know, you're the only
person in my life, that's stuck?

1382
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,312
You know me better than anyone else,

1383
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:44,834
and I love you,

1384
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:49,417
but I don't want either
of our lives to change.

1385
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,458
I just want to bring sex
into the equation and,

1386
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:56,377
and I only want it to be with you.

1387
01:18:58,125 --> 01:19:00,959
Let me get this straight,
you want to be my mistress?

1388
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:02,041
Yes.

1389
01:19:07,417 --> 01:19:08,792
Please, say something.

1390
01:19:09,667 --> 01:19:11,041
Do you really love me?

1391
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:12,625
Oh I love you with all my heart,

1392
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:14,962
that's why I want you to be happy.

1393
01:19:15,296 --> 01:19:18,744
I can't bear not
having you in my life.

1394
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:23,500
But I've also come to realize
that I like who I am,

1395
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:26,834
and relationships,
are tenuous at best,

1396
01:19:26,917 --> 01:19:28,542
and they're ever-evolving.

1397
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:29,625
A friendship?

1398
01:19:30,676 --> 01:19:33,468
That's something that
can last a lifetime.

1399
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:35,858
Why would I want to be with anyone

1400
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:37,744
who doesn't want all of me?

1401
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:39,917
Who's scared to take the risk

1402
01:19:39,953 --> 01:19:42,431
of putting her feelings on the line?

1403
01:19:42,617 --> 01:19:44,720
I think you're still just
taking the easy way out.

1404
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:48,123
So you want me to change who
I am to be loved by you?

1405
01:19:48,134 --> 01:19:50,353
I mean you of all people,

1406
01:19:50,603 --> 01:19:52,490
I never thought you'd ask me that.

1407
01:19:52,501 --> 01:19:54,295
And I don't want the
kind of relationship

1408
01:19:54,306 --> 01:19:55,807
that you're used to having.

1409
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:57,625
It's not enough.

1410
01:19:58,417 --> 01:19:59,834
It's not enough.

1411
01:19:59,917 --> 01:20:01,402
How can this not be enough?

1412
01:20:01,413 --> 01:20:03,605
I'm giving you the world.

1413
01:20:03,616 --> 01:20:06,041
I want someone who wants more from me

1414
01:20:06,052 --> 01:20:07,653
than the parts that
make them feel good.

1415
01:20:07,663 --> 01:20:09,128
I want them to care enough

1416
01:20:09,139 --> 01:20:10,521
to be committed to be in the moment.

1417
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:13,114
I want someone who cares for me,
and loves me,

1418
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:15,750
and will be in the trenches with me,

1419
01:20:15,834 --> 01:20:17,667
and not just throw me
a rope to help me out.

1420
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:19,250
But you have Kristen for that.

1421
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:21,250
I want you for that.

1422
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:22,632
But I'm a mess.

1423
01:20:22,867 --> 01:20:25,867
I'm broken.

1424
01:20:25,878 --> 01:20:28,772
I'm emotionally claustrophobic.

1425
01:20:28,834 --> 01:20:29,834
I'm--

1426
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:32,428
Lovely.

1427
01:20:38,192 --> 01:20:40,109
What's this about?

1428
01:20:41,521 --> 01:20:44,033
I can't imagine my life without you.

1429
01:20:46,584 --> 01:20:49,292
I love you enough to make this work.

1430
01:20:50,651 --> 01:20:51,651
Your way.

1431
01:20:52,695 --> 01:20:53,820
Huh?

1432
01:20:53,926 --> 01:20:54,926
What?

1433
01:20:57,632 --> 01:20:58,684
Nothing.

1434
01:20:58,695 --> 01:20:59,695
Okay.

1435
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:01,937
What?

1436
01:21:01,948 --> 01:21:04,048
Nothing, nothing.

1437
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:14,750
Come on, you guys.

1438
01:21:14,834 --> 01:21:16,375
This isn't that kind of venue.

1439
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:19,333
Get a room.

1440
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:38,934
Hi beautiful.

1441
01:21:40,674 --> 01:21:43,132
As requested I brought some
more copies of my book.

1442
01:21:43,143 --> 01:21:45,352
Put them on the table,
I'll get right to them.

1443
01:21:52,882 --> 01:21:54,507
What?

1444
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:57,458
It's daylight, it's public.

1445
01:21:57,542 --> 01:21:59,166
What are you thinking?

1446
01:22:01,471 --> 01:22:03,513
I'll roll the dice.

1447
01:22:09,441 --> 01:22:11,333
Wait a minute, I didn't
know we were scheduled

1448
01:22:11,344 --> 01:22:12,364
to have lunch today.

1449
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:13,346
We're not.

1450
01:22:13,357 --> 01:22:15,520
I'm here to take out the
number one salesman of my book.

1451
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,447
I told him if he sold three copies,

1452
01:22:17,458 --> 01:22:18,709
I'd buy him lunch.

1453
01:22:18,792 --> 01:22:20,417
And they're all gone.

1454
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,333
All right,
well that means desert too.

1455
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:23,500
Excellent.

1456
01:22:23,544 --> 01:22:25,282
Well, bring me a doggie bag.

1457
01:22:25,332 --> 01:22:27,808
What's in it for me?

1458
01:22:27,819 --> 01:22:29,445
My gratitude.

1459
01:22:29,456 --> 01:22:31,164
That means everything.

1460
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:33,222
Ah, bye.

1461
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,114
Great show last night.

1462
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,583
Thank you.

1463
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:47,000
How's Steve?

1464
01:22:47,083 --> 01:22:48,333
Oh, I hope to have him

1465
01:22:48,417 --> 01:22:50,834
barefoot and pregnant in
the kitchen in no time.

1466
01:22:50,917 --> 01:22:53,208
Sounds like you're
making steady progress.

1467
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:56,000
That's us, a happily married couple.

1468
01:22:58,023 --> 01:22:59,600
Okay, so what's up?

1469
01:23:00,796 --> 01:23:02,294
You and I never had
any lunch date planned

1470
01:23:02,304 --> 01:23:03,583
for me selling your book.

1471
01:23:03,667 --> 01:23:04,542
No.

1472
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:06,542
And I'm also very
disappointed in you.

1473
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:07,625
I can see that.

1474
01:23:08,408 --> 01:23:10,179
And what's the problem?

1475
01:23:10,542 --> 01:23:12,933
The problem is I don't
know why we're at lunch.

1476
01:23:12,944 --> 01:23:15,291
Oh,
and also Ronnie told me this morning

1477
01:23:15,302 --> 01:23:16,532
about your little arrangement,

1478
01:23:16,542 --> 01:23:18,542
and I don't approve.

1479
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:20,041
That's why we're here.

1480
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,590
Can you keep a secret?

1481
01:23:22,601 --> 01:23:24,166
By now you should know I can.

1482
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,590
I mean from Ronnie.

1483
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:26,834
I want your word that

1484
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:28,750
what I'm about to tell
you stays between us.

1485
01:23:28,834 --> 01:23:31,035
You can't tell anyone,
not even your husband.

1486
01:23:31,046 --> 01:23:33,989
Okay well, one of the reasons
we do have a happy marriage

1487
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,069
is because we don't keep
secrets from one another.

1488
01:23:38,667 --> 01:23:40,015
Fair enough.

1489
01:23:40,056 --> 01:23:41,806
Okay, you get a pass on that.

1490
01:23:41,817 --> 01:23:43,375
But I want you to promise that Steve

1491
01:23:43,386 --> 01:23:45,222
will keep it in the vault.

1492
01:23:45,233 --> 01:23:48,208
As long as whatever it is
doesn't hurt Ronnie, yeah.

1493
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:50,038
I broke up with Kristen.

1494
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:51,917
I'm in love with Veronica.

1495
01:23:51,928 --> 01:23:54,694
I have no interest in
being with anyone else.

1496
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:57,750
Wow!

1497
01:23:57,834 --> 01:23:59,583
Well, why can't we tell?

1498
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:00,875
This would be so good for her.

1499
01:24:00,959 --> 01:24:02,359
Because that woman's a rare breed.

1500
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:04,959
She's not wired like anyone else,
and you know it.

1501
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:07,007
Okay, so why are you telling me?

1502
01:24:07,018 --> 01:24:08,536
Because you've always been
a little bird in her ear,

1503
01:24:08,546 --> 01:24:11,114
telling her to go out
and find a single guy,

1504
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:12,832
and leave the attached ones alone.

1505
01:24:12,843 --> 01:24:14,875
Well, you can't do that anymore.

1506
01:24:14,959 --> 01:24:16,375
I am the single guy.

1507
01:24:17,148 --> 01:24:20,202
Okay, and just how long do
you plan to keep this up?

1508
01:24:20,583 --> 01:24:22,405
As long as it takes.

1509
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:25,458
I'll tell her eventually,
but until then,

1510
01:24:25,542 --> 01:24:26,822
I need you to keep this a secret.

1511
01:24:28,667 --> 01:24:29,750
A lie by omission.

1512
01:24:31,148 --> 01:24:33,495
I knew there had to be a good kind.

1513
01:24:33,815 --> 01:24:36,000
Those are called surprises.

1514
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:37,083
Oh.

1515
01:24:38,659 --> 01:24:40,542
What are you doing?

1516
01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:42,917
Well,
can't I text Steve now and tell him?

1517
01:24:44,502 --> 01:24:45,987
Knock yourself out.

1518
01:24:53,291 --> 01:24:54,834
Hey guys.

1519
01:24:54,917 --> 01:24:58,228
Hey, I may not be as cute as Ian,
but it's delivered.

1520
01:24:58,239 --> 01:24:59,792
Thank you.

1521
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:02,153
Well, you still come a close second.

1522
01:25:02,355 --> 01:25:03,522
How was lunch?

1523
01:25:03,709 --> 01:25:04,817
It was great.

1524
01:25:04,828 --> 01:25:06,420
I told him if he
sold three more books

1525
01:25:06,431 --> 01:25:08,121
I'd take him to Disneyland.

1526
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:10,965
Don't worry, I gave him a talking to,

1527
01:25:10,976 --> 01:25:13,644
and no more lies,
only nice surprises.

1528
01:25:13,655 --> 01:25:15,697
Thank you, Trent.

1529
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:19,709
So, how about dinner and a movie?

1530
01:25:19,792 --> 01:25:21,593
Well, that's a nice surprise.

1531
01:25:21,604 --> 01:25:23,270
Wonderful.

1532
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:25,145
I'll see you at seven.

1533
01:26:02,031 --> 01:26:04,636
If you need to make a call,
it's okay.

1534
01:26:11,312 --> 01:26:12,978
Nope.

1535
01:26:13,482 --> 01:26:15,482
Everyone I need to
talk to is right here.

1536
01:26:15,493 --> 01:26:16,493
Hmm.

1537
01:26:18,195 --> 01:26:19,195
What?

1538
01:26:20,718 --> 01:26:21,718
Nothing.

1539
01:26:23,276 --> 01:26:24,900
Okay.

1540
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:26,547
What?

1541
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:29,249
Nothing, really.

1542
01:26:33,664 --> 01:26:36,579
At least you could
promise me a movie.
